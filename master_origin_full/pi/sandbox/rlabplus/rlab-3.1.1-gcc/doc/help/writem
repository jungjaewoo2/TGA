        writem ( "filename" , [4mA[24m )

      [1mDescription[0m

        Writem is the counterpart to readm. Writem writes the matrix [4mA[0m
        to the file denoted by the 1st argument in a generic format.

        The format used is:



          line 1:         value[1;1]    ... value[1;ncol] \n
          line nrow:      value[nrow;1] ... value[nrow;ncol] \n





     Writem will write real and complex numeric matrices, as well as
     string matrices even though readm can only read real numeric
     matrices. Complex matrices are written as a single 2*nrow by
     ncolumn real matrix. Sparse matrices are written as triplets (row
     column value) for each element of the matrix.

     Writem does not close the file after writing [4mA[24m. The file is left
     open for further writes if necessary. Close can be called to
     explicitly close the file.
