		<p>Finds a best fit polynomial to a set of data points.
	
	<tag> Syntax </tag> 
 		
 		<p><tt>c = polyfit ( <em>Y</em>, <em>X</em>/, <em>options</em>/ )</tt>


	   Arguments:
		<descrip>
  		<tag><em>Y</em>, <em>X</em></tag> 
   		ordinatae and abscisae of the data points which are fitted to a polynomial.
		<tag><em>options</em> =<< maxdeg;f;error >></tag> 
			<em>maxdeg</em> is the maximal degree of polynomial being sought, where the
			degree must be	smaller than the number of given points.
			The criterion for the fit is given either in terms of f-statistics threshold,
			as <em>f = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1</em>, or through absolute error criterion in terms
			of <em>error</em>.
   	</descrip>
   
	   Result:
   	<descrip>
   	<tag><em>c</em> = << coef;error;degree >></tag> 
   		with <em>coef</em> being the coefficients of the best fit polynomial, 
   		<em>degree</em> its degree and <em>error</em> the maximal error in 
   		the coefficients.

	The solver is built upon a fortran routine DPOLFT from the SLATEC library.
