<p>isnan ( <em>A</> )
<tag> Description </tag>

	isnan returns TRUE (1) if <em>A</> is a NaN (Not A Number). If
	<em>A</> is a vector or a matrix the test is performed
	element-by-element, and a matrix the same size as <em>A</> is
	returned.

	NaNs can be created by the 0/0 operation on most computers.

	Example:
<tscreen><verb>
> a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, nan(); 7, 8, 9]
 a =
        1          2          3  
        4          5         nan  
        7          8          9  
> isnan (a)
        0          0          0  
        0          0          1  
        0          0          0
