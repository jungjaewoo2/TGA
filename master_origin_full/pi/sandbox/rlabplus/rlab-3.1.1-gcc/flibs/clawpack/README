CLAWPACK Notes for rlabplus

This is a modified version of CLAWPACK Version 4.1 by Randall J. LeVeque. The original
code can be downloaded from the author's web site http://www.amath.washington.edu/~claw/.
Changes:

1. All the files but ones in 1d/lib, 2d/lib and 3d/lib are removed.

2. For claw1 the following functions are in c instead of in FORTRAN, and are located
in file claw1.c (see also clawpack.h): b4step1, bc1right, bc1left, claw1r and src1.

3. There is a file  claw1rl.f  which contains the following functions which were
originally in 1d/lib: claw1rl and rp1.

Please report any bugs, problems, comments to kostrun@phys.uconn.edu.
