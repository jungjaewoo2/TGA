c     `tol' Tolerance applied to an estimate of the defect of the approximate
c           solution; the defect is the amount by which the continuous
c           approximate solution, u(t), fails to satisfy the ODE system.
c           We require |def(t)|/(|f(t,u(t))|+1) to be less than `tol', where
c           y'(t)=f(t,y(t)) is the ODE and def(t)= u'(t)-f(t,u(t)).
c           The same tolerance is applied to all defect components.
c
c     `neqns' Number of differential equations. Also number of boundary
c                                                                  conditions.
c     `Nsub' On input, number of subintervals into which the problem
c            interval is initially partitioned.
c     `MxNsub' Maximum number of subintervals.
c     `mesh_input' a) A value of 0 indicates that a uniform initial mesh
c                     should be set up by `mirkdc'.
c                  b) A value of 1 indicates that an initial mesh has
c                     already been provided by the user in the array `mesh'.
c                     This option should be chosen if the user has specific
c                     knowledge of the solution behavior.
c                  c) A value of 2 indicates that the user is employing
c                     continuation to solve the problem and that the mesh
c                     from a previous run will be stored in the array `mesh'.
c     `mesh' On input, the set of points that partition the problem
c            interval; initially empty if `mesh_input' = 0.
c     `sol_input' a) Normal use of `mirkdc' requires that `sol_input'=1,
c                    indicating that an initial solution estimate is to be
c                    provided by the user through the `init_Y' routine. It
c                    is recommended that `Y' not be set to a constant.
c                 b) The option `sol_input' = 2 should only be chosen when
c                    using continuation to solve a problem, where `Y' takes
c                    its value from the solution of a previous run. A value
c                    of 2 indicates that an initial solution estimate at each
c                    mesh point is available in the array `Y'.
c     `Y' On input, if `sol_input'=2, this is the initial discrete
c         approximation to the solution, evaluated at each meshpoint.
c         Externally, in the interfaces with the user main program and
c         subroutines, `Y' is a two-dimensional array; the i-th column of `Y'
c         stores the solution approximation for the i-th mesh point. Each
c         solution approximation is of length `neqns'; the resulting
c         dimensions of `Y' are `neqns x (Nsub+1)'. Inside MIRKDC it is
c         convenient for `Y' to be stored as a column vector; in this
c         one-dimensional version the solutions at each meshpoint come one
c         after the other rather than side by side as they are in the
c         two-dimensional array.
c     `ldY' The leading dimension of Y. (`ldY' >= `neqns').
c     `output_control' Controls the amount of information output. Provides
c                      profiling of code execution for activities such as the
c                      Newton iteration, mesh selection, or defect estimation.
c                             0 - None. 1 - Intermediate. 2 - Full.
c   exports:
c     double precision      mesh(0:Nsub)
c     double precision      Y(ldY*(Nsub+1))
      integer               info
c
c     `mesh' On output, the set of points which define the final mesh.
c     `Y' On output, if `info'=0, the converged discrete solution, evaluated
c         on the final mesh.
c     `info' Communication flag:
c                0 - implies a successful termination - solution obtained such
c                    that the defect is within user specified tolerance.
c               -1 - implies an unsuccessful termination - the required size for
c                    the new mesh is be too large.
c            Internal flag:
c              The Newton iteration can fail for one of several reasons, each
c              signaled by a non-zero `info' value. Even if the Newton
c              iteration converges, the resultant solution may be
c              unsuitable because the defect is too large. During the
c              execution of `mirkdc', `info' may take on the values given
c              below. None of these conditions lead directly to an
c              unsuccessful termination. Rather, the code will react by
c              attempting to double the size of the mesh and try again.
c                1 - too many iterations were taken without convergence being
c                    obtained.
c                2 - a singular coefficient matrix was encountered during the
c                    attempted solution of the Newton system.
c                3 - (a) it was impossible to obtain a suitable damping factor
c                    for the Newton update (indicative of an "effectively
c                    singular" Jacobian) or (b) evaluation of natural criterion
c                    function overflowed, indicative of a divergent iteration.
c                4 - the defect was too large and the solution from the Newton
c                    system could not be trusted.
c   work space:

c     `iwork' Integer work array provided to the `newiter' routine.
c     `work' Double precision work array used within `mirkdc' and provided to

c            The largest amount of workspace used is during the call to
c            `Newiter'. The space required then is at most

c***overview***
c
c        This routine takes as input the current iterate, `Y' and computes
c     a related function known as the natural criterion function, `g' = g(Y) =
c     0.5*|inv(J)*PHI(Y)|**2, where PHI(Y) is the residual function evaluated
c     at `Y' and J is the Jacobian of the residual function evaluated at `Y',
c     or possibly at a previous value of the iterate if a Fixed Jacobian
c     iteration is employed. See [Ascher, Mattheij, and Russell, 1988,
c     Pg. 335]. The intermediate quantities that arise during the calculation
c     of `g', namely, `PHI = PHI(Y)' and `delta = inv(J)*PHI(Y)', are returned
c     because they can be useful during the next step of the iteration.
c     The mesh of `Nsub' subintervals is stored in `mesh'; `neqns' is the
c     number of differential equations and the factored Jacobian is provided
c     in the arrays `top', `blocks', `bot', and `pivot'. The number of boundary
c     conditions imposed at the left endpoint is `leftbc'. The stages values
c     generated by the `resid' routine are stored in the `k_discrete'
c     array are passed out of this routine for use by other parts of the code.
c     `work' is a work array passed to the `resid' routine and used here for
c     temporary storage. The array, `work', is a work array.
c     The subroutines, `Fsub', and `Gsub', are provided by the user to define
c     the boundary value ODE and the boundary conditions.

c***declaration of constants***
      integer Mxs
      parameter(Mxs=10)
c
c     `Mxs' Maximum value for the total number of stages of the RK method.
c
c     We wish to be able to detect when the value of the criterion
c     function will overflow. Thus we set the overflow guard to

c             the coefficient matrix of the Newton system in factored form
c             subsequent to the call to `COLROW'.

c             function.
c     `g' Value of natural criterion function at `Y'.

c                  all subintervals. The ith set of `s*neqns'
c                  locations of `k_discrete' contains the `s'
c                  stages, each of length `neqns' corresponding

c            a temporary copy of the contents of `PHI' provided
c            to `crslve' because `crslve' will overwrite the
c            contents of the `PHI' vector, which we need to export.

c     `profile' Controls output, to standard output, of profiling infor-
c               mation such as Newton iteration counts, mesh selection,

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
c***evaluate natural criterion function at Y ****
c     First we compute PHI(Y) by calling `resid'; the value will
c     be returned in the vector `PHI'.
c
      call resid(neqns,leftbc,Nsub,mesh,Y,PHI,
     +                                 k_discrete,work,Fsub,Gsub)
c
c     We next compute `delta = inv(J)*PHI(Y)' by solving
c     the corresponding linear system .  J, stored in `top',
c     `blocks', `bot', and `pivot' has already been
c     factored so we can simply call `crslve' to get the solution
c     corresponding to the right hand side, PHI(Y), stored in `PHI'.
c     Since `crslve' would overwrite `PHI', we actually provide
c     only a copy of `PHI' to `crslve'.
c
      call dcopy((Nsub+1)*neqns,PHI,1,work,1)
c
      call crslve(top, leftbc, neqns, blocks,
     +     neqns,2*neqns,Nsub,bot,neqns-leftbc,pivot,work,delta)
c
c     We complete this calculation by computing the value of the
c     natural criterion function at `Y'. In terms of the quantities we
c     have just computed, this is `g = 0.5*|delta|**2'.
c
      g =  dabs(delta(idamax((Nsub+1)*neqns,delta,1)))
c
c     Here we insert a test here to guard against overflow. If the
c     norm of the Newton correction is large enough that its square
c     overflows, the iteration is in difficulty anyway.
c     We signal difficulty by setting g to -1.0. The negative g
c     condition will be trapped by the calling routine, and the
c     iteration will be terminated.
c
      if (g .GT. overflow_guard) then
                  g = -1.0d0
                  if (PROFILE .GT. PRINT_LEVEL_1) then
                      write(6,*)'Natural criterion function overflow'
                  end if
      else
                  g = 0.5d0 * g**2
                  if (PROFILE .GT. PRINT_LEVEL_2) then
                        write(6,*)'Natural criterion function value',g
                  end if
      endif
c
      return

c***overview***
c
c           This routine takes a discrete solution approximation, `Y', provided
c     on a mesh of `Nsub' subintervals (contained in `mesh') and uses
c     an iteration to produce a suitable value for the damping
c     factor `lambda', for use in a damped Newton update of `Y'. The number
c     of differential equations is `neqns', while the number of boundary
c     conditions at the lefthand endpoint of the problem interval is `leftbc'.
c
c           With the iterate `Y' stored in `Y_0' and the corresponding Newton
c     correction input in `delta_0', this routine predicts a new value
c     for `lambda' and then computes a trial iterate value
c     `Y = Y_0 - lambda*delta_0'. Its acceptability is measured by
c     whether or not it produces a sufficient reduction in the natural
c     criterion function `g = 0.5*|delta|^2', where `delta = inv(J)*PHI',
c     where J is evaluated at `Y_0', the previous iterate, and PHI is the
c     value of the residual function at the trial iterate `Y'. The arrays
c     `top', `bot', `blocks', contain the derivative information associated
c     with the Jacobian matrix J and `pivot' contains the pivoting information
c     for the linear system solution. The new `g' value is compared with the
c     previous value stored in `g_0'. If the reduction is not sufficient, a new
c     damping factor is chosen, if possible, and then this evaluation
c     step is repeated.  If it is found that it is impossible to find a
c     suitable damping factor, this is interpreted as a signal that the
c     entire Newton iteration will not converge. This is indicated by
c     setting `info' = 3. `lambda_min' is a minimum value for the
c     damping factor. A successful return is indicated by `info'= 0. A large
c     natural criterion function value, `g', signifies difficulty in the
c     Newton iteration and is indicated by `info' = 3.
c
c           At the end of a successful search for a damping factor, it may be
c     appropriate to take one or more fixed_Jacobian steps. The criterion is
c     that the current damped Newton step was a full Newton step i.e.
c     `lambda' = 1. This is signaled by setting `Fixed_Jacobian' to TRUE.

c           A by-product of the call to `resid' is the calculation of
c     intermediate quantities associated with the underlying Runge-Kutta method
c     called stages. These are returned in the array called `k_discrete'.
c     This array is exported through the parameter list for later use
c     during the construction and evaluation of the interpolant associated
c     with the Runge-Kutta method. The array, `work', is a work array.
c     The subroutines, `Fsub', and `Gsub', are provided by the user to define
c     the boundary value ODE and the boundary conditions.

c***initialization***
c     Two parameters which control the search for a suitable damping
c     factor are defined here:
c
c     (a)  `sigma' ensures that the reduction in the size of the natural
c           criterion function `g', evaluated at the new iterate, will be
c           nonnegligible. This keeps the iteration from stalling.
c
c     (b)  `tau' controls how much the values for `lambda' are allowed to
c           change from one step to the next in the iteration performed by
c           this routine.
      sigma = 0.01d0
      tau = 0.1d0
c
c     During the calculation of trial iterates for the determination
c     of a suitable damping factor, `Y' will be overwritten, so
c     save the current iterate, stored in `Y', in the vector, `Y_0'.
      call dcopy((Nsub+1)*neqns,Y,1,Y_0,1)
c
c***iterative selection of new damping factor***

c***overview***
c
c            This routine takes a mesh of `Nsub' subintervals, partitioning
c     the problem interval and a discrete initial approximation provided
c     at the meshpoints, (contained in the vectors `Y' and `mesh',
c     respectively) and  uses a full or damped Newton step to refine a
c     solution approximation for the associated discrete nonlinear system.
c     Convergence occurs if the Newton correction is less than the
c     tolerance `newtol' and is indicated by `convrg' = TRUE. The
c     number of differential equations is `neqns', while the number of
c     boundary conditions at the lefthand endpoint of the problem interval
c     is `leftbc'. A successful return is indicated by `info'= 0. If this
c     routine encounters a singular matrix, it signals this be setting
c     `info' = 2. A large natural criterion function value, `g', signifies
c     difficulty and is indicated by `info' = 3. On the other hand, if the
c     iteration appears to be converging well, this routine will signal that
c     the iteration can switch over to a fixed Jacobian step (see below).
c
c            At the beginning of each damped Newton step, it is assumed that
c     the current iterate value, `Y', and the value of the residual function,
c     `PHI', evaluated at `Y' are available. If the previous step was also
c     a damped Newton step, this routine also expects `delta = inv(J)*PHI',
c     where J, the Jacobian, is evaluated at the previous iterate and
c     `delta_0_norm', the norm of the previous value of `delta_0 = inv(J)*PHI',
c     where both J and `PHI' are associated with the previous iterate. The
c     step begins with the evaluation of then Jacobian of the residual function
c     at the current iterate, `Y'. The Newton system, consisting of the
c     Jacobian as the coefficient matrix and `PHI', as the right hand side, is
c     then solved to obtain the full Newton correction, which we store in the
c     vector `delta_0'. The factored Jacobian is available in the vectors
c     `top', `bot', `blocks'. Pivoting information for the solution of the
c     linear system is stored in `pivot'. During the call to `damp_factor' the
c     current iterate is copied into `Y_0', a damping factor, `lambda' is
c     computed, and then a damped Newton step is taken to produce a new
c     iterate, `Y = Y_0 - lambda*delta_0'.
c
c           At the end of a successful damped Newton step, it may be
c     appropriate to take one or more fixed Jacobian steps . The criterion
c     is that the current damped Newton step was a full Newton step
c     (`lambda'=1). This is signaled by setting `Fixed_Jacobian' to TRUE.
c     The fixed Jacobian step, for reasons associated with efficient data
c     management, expects to receive a number of quantities : (i) the new
c     iterate, `Y', (ii) the residual function evaluated at this new iterate,
c     `PHI', (iii) `delta = inv(J)*PHI', where J, the Jacobian, has been
c     evaluated rather at the previous iterate  and (iv) the value of the
c     natural criterion function, `g = 0.5*|delta|**2'. All these values are
c     to be naturally computed during the current damped Newton step and
c     thus will be already set up for the fixed Jacobian step if appropriate.
c
c           A by-product of the evaluation of the right hand side of the
c     Newton system is the calculation of intermediate quantities associated
c     with the underlying Runge-Kutta method called stages. These are
c     returned to the `damped_newt' routine when it calls the `damp_factor'
c     routine and are stored in the array called `k_discrete'.
c     This array is exported through the parameter list for later use
c     during the construction and evaluation of the interpolant associated
c     with the Runge-Kutta method. The array, `work', is a work array provided
c     to the `damp_factor' and `newmat' routines. The subroutines, `Fsub',
c     `Gsub', `Dfsub', and `Dgsub', are provided by the user to define the
c     boundary value ODE and the boundary conditions and their derivatives.

c***overview***
c
c        This routine uses the discrete solution approximation, `Y',
c     obtained on the mesh stored in `mesh', plus the stages of the underlying
c     RK method, stored in `k_discrete', plus some new stages, stored in
c     `k_interp', to construct an interpolant for `Y'. `neqns' is the number of
c     differential equations; `Nsub' is the the number of subintervals into
c     which the mesh divides the problem interval. This interpolant is then used
c     to compute an estimate of the defect on each subinterval, for each
c     solution component. The i-th group of `neqns' locations of `defect' is
c     used to store the relative defect information associated with the i-th
c     subinterval. The max norm of the relative defect is returned in
c     `defect_norm'. A successful return is indicated by `info = 0'. If the
c     `defect_norm' is bigger than the constant parameter `defect_threshold'
c     then `info' is set to 4.
c
c         The primary information required to define the interpolant on the i-th
c     subinterval is the current solution approximation at the (i-1)-st and
c     i-th mesh points (which can be obtained from `Y'), and some
c     stages associated with the i-th interval.  The first `s' stages come
c     from the discrete formula, and have already been computed. They are
c     available in the `s' vector locations making up the i-th set of
c     `s*neqns' locations of the vector,'k_discrete'. The remaining
c     `s_star - s' stages are required only for the interpolant and must
c     now be computed . For each subinterval, this is done through a call
c     to the `interp_setup' routine, which returns the new stage evaluations
c     for that subinterval. The resultant stages are then stored in the
c     appropriate locations of the `k_interp' vector (which has the same
c     format as the `k_discrete' vector).
c
c           On the i-th subinterval the evaluation of the interpolant at
c     `t = mesh(i-1)+tau*hi' is given by `z(t) = yim1 + hi sum br(tau)*kr',
c     where `hi' is the subinterval size, 'yim1' is the solution approximation
c     at `mesh(i-1)', `kr' is the r-th stage, `br(tau)' is the corresponding
c     weight polynomial evaluated at `tau' and the sum runs from 1 to `s_star'.
c
c            Once the interpolant  is available, we can sample
c     the defect at the point, `mesh(i-1)+tau*hi', by substituting the
c     interpolant into the differential equation and subtracting the right
c     side from the left side, i.e. the defect on the i-th subinterval is
c     `delta = z'(mesh(i-1)+tau*hi)-f(mesh(i-1)+tau*hi,z(mesh(i-1)+tau*hi))'.
c     A blended relative/absolute defect measure, `defect', equal to
c     `|delta|/(|f|+1)' is computed, where `f' is the corresponding right hand
c     side of the ODE.
c
c            The sample point is available from the /sample_point/ common
c     block and the subsequent evaluation of the weights is done by a call
c     to the `interp_weights' routine. To improve the reliability of the
c     defect estimate, we also sample at `1-tau' and choose the larger of
c     the two defect values for the estimate, `delta'.
c
c            `z','z_prime,'def_1','def_2','f_1','f_2','temp_1','temp_2'
c     are work arrays used for temporary storage here while `work'
c     is a work array passed to `interp_setup'. The subroutine, `Fsub',
c     is provided by the user to define the boundary value ODEs.

c     `pivot', has not been evaluated at `Y', but rather at some previous
c     iterate and (iv) the value of the natural criterion function, `g', at
c     the iterate, `Y'.
c
c          The fixed Jacobian step consists of first computing  a (potential)
c     new iterate, `Y_hat = Y - delta'. The acceptability of `Y_hat' is
c     determined  by evaluating the natural criterion function at `Y_hat',
c     giving `g_hat'. During the calculation of `g_hat, it is necessary to
c     evaluate the residual function at `Y_hat' and store it in the vector,
c     `PHI_hat', and a new value for `delta = inv(J)*PHI_hat', both of which
c     will then be available for the next step of the iteration. The
c     acceptability of the new iterate value is determined by comparing `g_hat'
c     with the value of the natural criterion function for the previous iterate,
c     stored in `g'. If `g_hat < rho*g' then the new iterate value is accepted
c     and another fixed Jacobian step is attempted. If `g_hat > rho*g', the
c     code returns to taking damped Newton steps (the value of `rho' is set in
c     this routine). This is signaled by setting `Fixed_Jacobian' to FALSE.
c     The value of `lambda', the damping factor, is set to 0 as well. This is
c     to indicate appropriate information for the prediction of a new damping
c     factor is not available for the upcoming damped Newton step.
c
c           A by-product of the evaluation of the right hand side of the
c     Newton system is the calculation of intermediate quantities associated
c     with the underlying Runge-Kutta method called stages. These are
c     returned in the array called `k_discrete', which is exported through
c     the parameter list for later use during the construction and evaluation
c     of the interpolant associated with the Runge-Kutta method. The array,
c     `work', is a work array. The subroutines, `Fsub', and `Gsub', are provided
c     by the user to define the boundary value ODE and the boundary conditions.

c***overview***
c
c          This routine uses the current discrete solution approximation, `Y',
c     obtained on a mesh of `Nsub' subintervals, stored in `mesh', plus
c     additional stage information associated with the underlying discrete RK
c     method, to compute an evaluation of an interpolant to the discrete
c     solution.  This interpolant is evaluated at `t', with the value returned
c     in `z', and the value of the first derivative returned in `z_prime'.
c
c          The interpolant is computed as follows: Given `t', assumed to
c     be somewhere in the problem interval, the subinterval of `mesh' that
c     contains `t' is determined first, i.e. we find i such that
c                `mesh(i-1) =< t < mesh(i) for t < mesh(Nsub)' or
c                `i = Nsub for t = mesh(Nsub)'.
c     The fraction of the way `t' is through the i-th subinterval, a quantity
c     which we call `tau', is also determined during this step. Then the
c     interpolant on this i-th subinterval is evaluated - the interpolant has
c     the form `z(mesh(i-1) + tau*hi) = yim1 + hi sum br(tau)*kr'.
c     The weights, `br(tau)', can be computed with a call to `interp_weights'.
c
c          The remaining information required to define the interpolant
c     on the i-th subinterval is the current solution approximation at the
c     (i-1)st mesh point, `yim1', which can be obtained from `Y', and the
c     stages associated with the i-th subinterval. The first `s' stages,
c     contained in `k_discrete', come from the discrete formula and
c     remaining `s_star - s' stages, contained in `k_interp', are necessary
c     for the interpolant. Each stage is a vector of length `neqns' where
c     `neqns' is the number of differential equations.
c
c          `k_discrete' is the vector containing the discrete stages for
c     all subintervals. The i-th set of `s*neqns' locations of `k_discrete'
c     contains the `s' stages, each of length `neqns' corresponding to the
c     i-th subinterval. `k_interp' plays a similar role for the `s_star-s'
c     stages associated with the interpolant.

c***overview***
c
c         The purpose of this routine is to perform some preliminary
c     calculations to set up stages for later use in the evaluation of the
c     interpolant. The interpolant is defined on the i-th subinterval by,
c          `Z_i(tim1 + hi*tau) = yim1 + hi sum b_r(tau)*k_r',
c     where the stages, `k_r', depend on `yim1' and `yi', the solution
c     approximations at the left and right endpoints, `hi', the size of the
c     subinterval, 'tim1' the left endpoint, and the coefficients of the
c     underlying Runge-Kutta method. The weight polynomials, `b_r(tau)', can be
c     evaluated through a call to the `interp_weights' routine.
c     The first `s' stages of each subinterval were already obtained during the
c     computation of the discrete solution, so only the last `s_star - s' stages
c     need to be computed now.
c
c         This routine will construct the `s_star-s' extra stages needed by
c     the interpolant for a single subinterval. This routine takes as input
c     the vector, `ki_discrete', containing the `s' stages associated with
c     the discrete formula on the i-th subinterval, and then uses the
c     Runge-Kutta coefficients for the extra stages, available from the
c     `/interp_coeffs/' common block, to construct the `s_star' new stages.
c     These are returned in the vector `ki_interp'. Each stage is a vector of
c     length `neqns', where `neqns' is the number of differential equations.
c     `y' is a work array. The subroutine, `Fsub', is provided by the user to
c     define the boundary value ODE.

c
c      The interpolant is defined on a subinterval by subinterval basis, as
c      follows: When t can be expressed as t_i + hi*tau for some i and tau,
c      with hi = t_i+1 - t_i then the interpolant, Z(t) = Zi(t_i+ hi*tau) =
c      yi + hi sum br(tau)*kr, where the kr depend on information from the ith
c      subinterval as well as certain blending and coupling coefficients that
c      are specific to the MIRK formula and interpolant. br(tau) is the rth
c      weight polynomial of the interpolant evaluated at tau.
c
c        The main purpose of this routine is to define the parameter which
c      gives,`s_star', the total number of stages for the interpolant and the
c      coefficients for the `s_star-s' extra stages needed by the interpolant.
c      Once defined by this routine, the coefficients are then
c      available from the /interp_coeff/ common block, while `s_star' is
c      available from the /interp_s_star/ common block. The `order' of the
c      interpolant is available through the /interp_order/ common block.
c
c         This routine also defines the sample point, relative to the size
c      of a subinterval, at which the defect should be sampled. This is the
c      point at which the interpolant must be evaluated and is thus specific
c      to the particular interpolant being implemented.  The defect sample
c      point, which we call `tau_star', is made available through the
c      /sample_point/ common block.
c
c            The final portion of formula dependent information involves
c      the expressions for the weight polynomials, arising as part of the
c      definition of the interpolant for the discrete formula. This information
c      is provided through the `interp_weights' routine which evaluates all
c      the weight polynomials and their derivatives at a given point. This
c      routine can be called by other parts of the code whenever the weight
c      polynomials and derivatives are required - i.e. whenever an evaluation
c      of the interpolant is required.

c***overview***
c
c          This routine evaluates the weight polynomials (and their first
c      derivatives) corresponding to the `s_star' stages used to form the
c      interpolant for the discrete formula defined by the `RK_tableau'
c      routine. The evaluation takes place at `tau'. The results are returned
c      in the `s_star' locations of the vectors `w' and `wp'. The
c      interp_weights routine will be dependent on the parameter, `method'.
c      `method' defines the method to be used and will be accessed via the
c      /rk_method/ common block. The possible values for `method' and the
c      corresponding MIRK method associated with each of these values are
c      listed below.
c
c               Value of `method'   |   MIRK formula

c
c          The presence of the interp_weights routine demonstrates the use
c      of an "information hiding" principle. The more common approach would be
c      to simply provide the coefficients of the polynomial weights in
c      an array made available to the rest of the software package through
c      the /interp_coeffs/ common block. In the approach employed here we
c      "hide" the polynomial expression for each weight inside the
c      `interp_weights' routine whose function is to provide an evaluation
c      of the weights at a given point. An advantage of this approach is
c      that changes can be made in the method by which the weights are
c      determined with no subsequent change needed in the rest of the
c      software.

c       ****Evaluation of the Jacobian for one subinterval****
c
c           This routine computes the left and right blocks (of the Jacobian of
c       the residual function) associated with the i-th subinterval. The left
c       and right block values are returned in the parameters `LLi' and `RRi'.
c       Each block is of size `neqns**2', where `neqns' is the number of
c       differential equations. We have,
c
c                         s                               s

c                         r=1                             r=1
c
c      Each partial derivative, dkr/dyi, is computed as follows,
c
c                                          r-1

c                                          j=1,
c
c      with a similar expression for each dkr/dyi+1.
c
c         The solution value, yr, at which df/dy is evaluated depends on
c      the input parameters `yi' and `yip1', the solution approximations
c      at each end of the ith subinterval, and the previously computed
c      stages provided by the input parameter `k'. The size of the ith
c      subinterval is `hi' and the endpoint is `ti'. The computation of
c      `yr' also depends on the coefficients of the RK method provided
c      through the /RK_s/,/RK_coeff/ common blocks.

c***overview***
c
c     The purpose of this routine is to examine the relative defect
c     associated with a continuous solution approximation in order to decide
c     upon a good mesh. The `Nsub+1' points describing the current mesh are
c     passed in through the vector `mesh_current'. An estimate of the blended
c     relative/absolute defect, is passed in through the vector `defect',
c     which has `Nsub' components, each of size `neqns', where `neqns' is
c     the number of differential equations. The user defined tolerance, which
c     will be used to assess the relative defect, is passed in through the
c     parameter, `tol'.
c
c       After examining the blended relative/absolute defect, this routine
c     will call either the `half_mesh' routine, to generate a new mesh by
c     halving each subinterval of the current mesh, or the routine
c     `redistribute'. `redistribute' generates a new mesh with a different
c     number of points than the current mesh and with a different distribution
c     of points, depending how the relative defect is distributed over the
c     current mesh.
c
c       The redistribution process involves monitoring the mesh function
c     values which are based on the defect. A mesh redistribution is performed
c     if the maximum mesh function value, is sufficiently greater than
c     the average value. If so, a new mesh is determined that approximately
c     equidistributes the mesh function over the subintervals of the new mesh.
c     The number of points in the new mesh is determined from accuracy
c     considerations.
c
c          The algorithm implemented here is based on [Ascher, Mattheij, and
c     Russell, Chapter 9]. The number of subintervals in the new mesh is
c     returned in `Nsub_star', while the points of the new mesh are returned
c     in the vector `mesh_new'. This routine will fail if the prescribed number
c     of new points is greater than the maximum number allowed, `MxNsub', in
c     which case we set `info = -1' to signal this.
c
c     `s_hat' is used here for temporary storage.

c***overview***
c
c            This routine takes a mesh of `Nsub' subintervals, partitioning
c     the problem interval and a discrete initial approximation provided
c     at the meshpoints, (contained in the vectors `Y' and `mesh',
c     respectively) and uses a modified Newton method to produce a
c     solution approximation to within a tolerance of `newtol', for
c     the associated discrete nonlinear system `PHI(Y) = 0', where `PHI(Y)' is
c     the residual function. The number of differential equations
c     is `neqns', while the number of boundary conditions at the lefthand
c     endpoint of the problem interval is `leftbc'. The iteration completes
c     successfully if it produces a converged solution within `maxiter'
c     iterations. A successful return is indicated by `info'= 0. The
c     updated solution is returned in `Y'. The arrays `PHI', `delta', `top',
c     `bot', `blocks', `pivot', and `work' provide working space for the
c     `resid', `damped_newt', and `fixed_jacob' routines. This routine
c     provides, as a by-product, the stage values associated with the
c     application of a Runge-Kutta method on each subinterval of the mesh.
c     The array `k_discrete' returns these stages. The subroutines,
c     `Fsub', `Gsub', `Dfsub', and `Dgsub', are provided by the user to
c     define the boundary value ODE and the boundary conditions and their
c     derivatives.
c
c            The modified Newton iteration implemented here proceeds
c     through a sequence of steps, each of which must be either a damped
c     Newton step or a fixed Jacobian step. The code decides, depending
c     on how well the iterates appear to be converging, which type of step
c     to take each time. This routine is organized as follows. After some
c     initialization, we begin a loop which executes the modified Newton
c     iteration. The kind of step to be taken is controlled by the value of
c     the flag, `Fixed_Jacobian', which is initially set to FALSE since the
c     first step must be a full Newton step.
c
c            During a damped Newton step an iterative process is used to
c     choose a damping factor, `lambda', which is used to provide a damped
c     update to the current iterate `Y = Y - lambda*delta' where `delta' is
c     the Newton correction; `delta = inv(J)*PHI' where `PHI' is the residual
c     function evaluated at `Y' and J is the corresponding Jacobian also
c     evaluated at `Y'. The use of a damping factor can improve the
c     convergence properties of the Newton iteration as well as allowing for
c     the early detection of a divergent iteration. The update is accepted
c     if it produces a sufficient reduction in the value of the natural
c     criterion function (which is related to the size of the residual
c     function). At the end of a successful damped Newton step, the routine
c     takes a fixed Jacobian step if the step was a full Newton step
c     (i.e. `lambda' = 1).
c
c          The fixed Jacobian step consists of first computing a potential
c     new iterate, `Y_hat = Y - delta' where `delta' is the Newton correction
c     for this fixed Jacobian step. Here `delta = inv(J)*PHI', where `PHI' is
c     the residual function evaluated at `Y' and where J, the Jacobian, has
c     not been evaluated at `Y', but rather at some previous iterate.
c     The new iterate, `Y_hat' will be acceptable if it leads to a sufficient
c     reduction in the size of the natural criterion function. If the new
c     iterate value is accepted then another fixed Jacobian step is attempted.
c     Otherwise, the code returns to taking full Newton steps.
c
c            This routine can fail in three ways. If the Newton iteration takes
c     too many steps, the iteration halts with `info'=1. If a singular matrix is
c     encountered during the factorization of the Newton matrix (during the call
c     to `damped_newt'), the iteration halts with `info'=2. If it is impossible
c     for the `damped_newt' routine to obtain a suitable damping factor for the
c     Newton update (indicative of an ``effectively singular" Jacobian) the
c     iteration halts with `info'=3.

c***initialization for Newton iteration***
c      The number of damped Newton iterations (equal to the number of
c      Jacobian evaluations and factorizations) will be counted using the
c      variable `count' which is initialized to 0. The variable `convrg',
c      monitors whether the iteration has converged or not and is
c      initialized to .FALSE..
c
       count = 0
       convrg = .FALSE.
c
c      The first iteration step must be a damped Newton step.
c      This is handled by setting `Fixed_Jacobian' to .FALSE.
c
       Fixed_Jacobian = .FALSE.
c
c      When a damped Newton step is used, it is assumed that the current
c      iterate, `Y', and also the value of, `PHI', the residual function
c      at `Y' will be available from the previous iteration step. For the
c      first step, which will be a damped Newton step, `Y' will be
c      available, but the residual function must be computed here in
c      preparation for the first time through the damped Newton iteration
c      step. This is done by calling `resid' which will return with the
c      residual function stored in the vector `PHI'.

c
c      In order to predict the new damping factor, each damped Newton step
c      also assumes several other quantities are available from the previous
c      iteration step. For the first step, these will not be available. In
c      order for the prediction algorithm to detect this situation we set

c***overview***
c
c            This routine computes the Newton matrix for the discrete system
c     modeling the BVP.  The Newton matrix is the Jacobian of the residual
c     function.  It is evaluated at the current iterate `Y'. The Jacobian is
c     returned in the three vectors `top',`bot', and `blocks'; `top' contains
c     the elements of the Jacobian associated with the boundary  conditions
c     evaluated at the left endpoint - it consists of `leftbc' rows, each
c     of size `neqns', where `leftbc' is the number of boundary conditions
c     imposed at the left endpoint, and `neqns' is the number of differential
c     equations; `bot'  contains  the  corresponding information for the right
c     endpoint. It consists of `neqns-leftbc' rows, each of length `neqns'.
c     The vector `blocks' contains, for the i-th subinterval of the mesh which
c     partitions the problem interval, as prescribed by the vector, `mesh', the
c     blocks L_i and R_i, i=1,...,Nsub where `Nsub' is the number of subinter-
c     vals defined by the mesh.
c
c           L_i is the derivative of the i-th component of the residual function
c     with respect to y_i; R_i is the derivative of the i-th component of the
c     residual function with respect to y_i+1. These blocks, stored column
c     by column, are placed in `blocks'  one  after the  other  in  the order
c     L_i, R_i, i=1,...,Nsub. Each such block is `neqns' rows, each of length
c     `neqns'.
c
c            This routine accesses the discrete stages for each subinterval,
c     which are computed by the `subcom' routine, and saved in the array
c     `k_discrete' provided to this routine through the parameter list. Thus
c     a precondition for the use of this routine is that the `resid' routine
c     has already been called, with the same `Y' input.  `work' is a work
c     array provided to `jacblk' and also used here.

c          y_i and y_i+1, the current solution approximations at the left and

c
c***computation of `top' and `bot'***
c
c       We now compute the parts of the Jacobian of the residual
c       function associated with the boundary conditions.
c
c       `Y(1)' is y_0, `Y(Nsub*neqns+1)' is y_Nsub. We call `Dgsub' to get
c       the boundary condition derivative information. The information is
c       returned in the vector `work'. Although, `work' is viewed inside
c       `Dgsub' as a square matrix of size `neqns' by `neqns', it is more
c       convenient to view it here in the usual columnwise fashion, i.e.
c       with the columns of the square matrix laid out one after the
c       other in the column vector, `work'.
c
c       Set the Jacobian to zero then call `Dgsub' to obtain the
c       non-zero entries.
c
        do 7 i = 1,neqns*neqns
          work(i) = 0.0d0
 7      continue
c
        call Dgsub(neqns,Y(1),Y(n1+1),work)
c
c       The vector `top' must be assigned the values corresponding to
c       the first `leftbc' rows of the square version of the boundary condition
c       matrix. Since `work' contains the elements of the boundary condition
c       matrix stored in a columnwise fashion, this corresponds to selecting
c       the first `leftbc' elements from each column stored within `work', and
c       copying them into the appropriate locations of the vector `top'.
c
c       The vector `top' will also store the first `leftbc' rows of the
c       boundary condition Jacobian in a columnwise fashion. Thus it will
c       consist of `neqns' vectors, each of length `leftbc', representing the
c       columns of the `leftbc' by `neqns' matrix corresponding to the
c       derivatives of the boundary conditions at the left end of the problem
c       interval.
c
c       A similar situation holds for the vector `bot', which will
c       contain, in a columnwise fashion, the `neqns-leftbc' by `neqns'
c       matrix, corresponding to the derivatives of the boundary conditions
c       at the right end of the problem interval. The variables `toploc',
c       `workloc', and `botloc' are used to identify, within their respective
c       vectors, the appropriate locations for the jth column, for j=1 to
c       `neqns'.
c
        do 25 j = 1, neqns
c
           toploc = (j-1)*leftbc
           workloc = (j-1)*neqns
           botloc = (j-1)*(neqns-leftbc)
c
c          Copy the first leftbc locations of the jth "column" of `work'
c          into the leftbc locations corresponding to the jth "column" of `top'.
c
           do 10 k = 1, leftbc
            top(toploc+k) = work(workloc+k)
10         continue
c
c          Copy the remaining `neqns-leftbc' locations of the jth "column"
c          of `work' into the `neqns-leftbc' locations corresponding to the
c          jth "column" of `bot'.

c      subinterval (see `mesh_selector' routine for further details). The
c      routine returns a new mesh, of `Nsub_star' points, which equidistributes
c      the integral of the mesh function over the subintervals of the new mesh
c      in the vector `mesh_new'.
c
c         The equidistribution is performed as follows. The idea is to select
c      new mesh points so that the area under the mesh function is equally
c      distributed over the subintervals of the new mesh. The total area under
c      the mesh function is first computed and then divided by the total number
c      of subintervals in the new mesh, giving a quantity we call `zeta'.
c      The value of the integral of the mesh function over each subinterval of
c      the new mesh must equal `zeta'. The area under the mesh function for
c      each subinterval of the old mesh is computed and added to a sum,
c      proceeding from left to right. Whenever the sum reaches a value beyond
c      `zeta', only the area of that fraction of the subinterval needed to
c      reach the value of `zeta' is added. This fraction is used to decide
c      where to place the new mesh point. The procedure beginning with the new
c      mesh point is repeated and continued until every subinterval of the
c      current mesh is processed. See [Ascher, Mattheij, Russell, Chap.9] for
c      details
c
c         This routine assumes that `Nsub_star' is less than or equal to the
c      maximum allowable number of subintervals.

c***overview***
c
c          This routine evaluates the residual function at the current
c     iterate, `Y', on the current mesh, `mesh'. The residual function value
c     is  returned  in  the vector `PHI'. The mesh has `Nsub' subintervals.
c
c          The evaluation  of the residual function is done in two phases:
c     one involving the calculation of the components  of `PHI' associated
c     with the boundary conditions (`leftbc' conditions at the left boundary
c     and `neqns-leftbc' at the right boundary, where `neqns' is the number of
c     differential equations), and the other associated  with  the
c     other `Nsub' components, each of size `neqns', corresponding  to each
c     subinterval of the current mesh. The  components  associated with
c     the boundary  conditions  are  obtained  directly  from  the  subroutine
c     `Gsub'.  Each  of  the other components  is obtained through a call
c     to the `subcom' routine.
c
c          In  the  first  part of  this  routine we perform the  necessary
c     initializations.  We next treat the components of `PHI'  related  to the
c     subintervals, and lastly deal with the components  corresponding  to the
c     boundary conditions.
c
c          A by-product of the call to `subcom' routine is the return
c     of the `s' stages that arise as intermediate quantities during the
c     computation of the part of `PHI' associated with the i-th subinterval.
c     These stage values will be used later during the call to `Newmat' and the
c     defect estimation phases of this code, and are stored here in the
c     `k_discrete' vector which is returned from this routine through the
c     parameter list. `work' is a work array provided to the `subcom' routine.

c
c***overview***
c
c          This routine uses the current solution approximation, `Y',
c       obtained on the mesh stored in `mesh', plus the stages of the
c       underlying discrete RK method plus some new stages associated with
c       the interpolant in order to evaluate the interpolant.  This interpolant
c       is evaluated at `t', with the value returned in `z', and the value of
c       the first derivative returned in `z_prime'.
c
c          The interpolant is computed as follows: Given `t', assumed to
c       be somewhere in the problem interval, the subinterval of `mesh' that
c       contains `t' is determined first, i.e. find i such that mesh(i-1)
c       =< t < mesh(i) for t < mesh(Nsub) or i = Nsub for t = mesh(Nsub).
c       The fraction of the way `t' is through the ith subinterval, a quantity
c       which we call `tau',  is also determined during this step. Then the
c       interpolant on this ith subinterval is evaluated - the interpolant has
c       the form z(mesh(i-1) + tau*hi) = yim1 + hi sum br(tau)*kr. The weights,
c       br(tau), can be computed with a call to `interp_weights'. `Nsub' is
c       the number of subintervals.
c
c          The remaining information required to define the interpolant
c       on the ith subinterval is the current solution approximation at the
c       (i-1)st mesh point, `yim1', which can be obtained from `Y', and the
c       stages associated with the ith subinterval. The first `s' stages,
c       contained in `k_discrete', come from the discrete formula and
c       remaining `s_star - s' stages, contained in `k_interp', are necessary
c       for the interpolant. Each stage is a vector of length `neqns' where
c       `neqns' is the number of differential equations.
c
c          `k_discrete' is the vector containing the discrete stages for
c       all subintervals. The ith set of `s*neqns' locations of `k_discrete'
c       contains the `s' stages, each of length `neqns' corresponding to the
c       ith subinterval. `k_interp' plays a similar role for the `s_star-s'
c       stages associated with the interpolant.

c***declaration of constants***
        integer Mxs
        parameter(Mxs=10)
c
c       `Mxs'    is the maximum value for the total number of stages
c                of the interpolant.
c
c***declaration of parameters***
c      imports:
        double precision t
c       `t'     the point at which the interpolant is to be evaluated.
c      exports:
c       double precision z(neqns)
        double precision z(*)
c
c       double precision z_prime(neqns)
        double precision z_prime(*)
c
        integer fail
c
c       `z'       is the value of the interpolant at x.
c
c       `z_prime' is the value of the first derivative of the
c                 interpolant at x.
c
c       `fail'    if fail = 1 then the point `t', at which the interpolant
c                 is to be evaluated, is outside the problem interval and
c                 therefore `sol_eval' will not produce a solution
c                 approximation. If fail = 0 then `t' is a valid meshpoint.

c  ***Subcom Routine(Calculation of subcomponents of residual function)***
c
c            The purpose of this routine is to evaluate the component
c       of PHI, the residual function, associated with the i-th sub-
c       interval. This component of PHI is returned through the parameter
c       `phii'.
c                                          s
c                                          --
c                     phii = yip1-yi- hi * <  br*kr
c                                          --
c                                          r=1
c
c       The evaluation takes place for the current iterate `Y'.
c       However, the i-th component of PHI depends only on the solution
c       information directly associated with the i-th subinterval, namely
c       yi and yi+1, which have been assigned to `yi' and `yip1'.  Also
c       the size of the i-th subinterval is assigned to `hi' and the left
c       hand endpoint of the ith subinterval is assigned to `ti'.
c
c            The calculation uses the s-stage MIRK formula defined by the
c       values of `s', `c',`v', `b' and `x' (as passed in from the
c       /RK_s/,/RK_coeff/ commom blocks), The solution approximation vectors,
c       `yi' and `yip1', as well as `phii', are of size `neqns', the number
c       of differential equations.
c
c            During the computation of `phii', we will compute `s'
c       intermediate vectors, kr, r=1..s, each of size `neqns', and called
c       the stages of the formula. The stages are stored in the  vector `k'
c       in order, and are returned by this routine for later use during the
c       call to `newmat' and during the interpolation phase.
c       `y' provides a work array of size `neqns'.
