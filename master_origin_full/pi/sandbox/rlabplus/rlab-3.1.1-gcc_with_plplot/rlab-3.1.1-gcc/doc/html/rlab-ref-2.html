<P>
<P>Now that you have seen how to start Rlab, run a program, get help,
and interpret error messages, you should be ready to try out some
elementary operations. These simple examples are here to help you
``get your feet wet''. Please read this section in front of a
computer, and try the examples as you read each one.
<P>Since this is a tutorial, every detail and nuance of each example
may not be fully explained. As you work through this section you may
have to take some ideas ``on faith''. However, everything should be
fully explained in subsequent sections of this manual. If you find
something that is not explained, please bring it to the author's
attention.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Fundamental Operations</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Rlab does not require definition of variable types and size, Unlike
more conventional languages such as: Fortran, Pascal, and C. This
approach may seem daring at first, but practice has shown that it is
most often a much more productive environment for rapid development
of programs than strictly typed languages.
<P>
<H3>Creating Matrices / Arrays</H3>

<P>
<P>For starters we will introduce the reader to basic operations that
are used in many applications. The first is to create a matrix or
array of data so that operations can be demonstrated. The matrix
elements are entered at the command line (or in a file). The commas
separate the elements of a row, and the semi-colons separate one row
from the next.
<P>

<P>The commas are <EM>required</EM> so that there are no ambiguities when
more complex expressions are used to create a matrix. For an
example, lets create the Attitude matrix for a 3-2-3 Euler angle
rotation. The variables <CODE>th</CODE>, <CODE>ph</CODE>, and <CODE>ps</CODE>
represent the three Euler angles. To make the notation more concise,
we will make the variables <CODE>c</CODE> and <CODE>s</CODE> copies of the
builtin functions <CODE>sin</CODE> and <CODE>cos</CODE>. Next the matrix is
entered, with the result displayed upon completion.

<P>The matrices we have created thus far: <CODE>a</CODE>, and <CODE>A</CODE> are
two-dimensional; they have row and column dimensions. Actually, all
arrays are two-dimensional. Row and column vectors merely have one
dimension equal to one, and scalar values have both dimensions equal
to one.
<P>The <CODE>show</CODE> function displays information about its argument. In
the following example, we see that the entire array <CODE>a</CODE> is a
3-by-3 matrix, from the numeric class, data type real, and uses
dense storage. Note that the scalar value <CODE>a[1]</CODE> is also the
same kind of object, just with different dimensions.

<H3>Reading Data From a File</H3>

<P>Numeric data can also be easily read from a file with the buitin
functions (see Section 
<A HREF="rlab-ref-5.html#reading-data">Data</A>). For
this example we will read a matrix stored in a text file. The
<CODE>readm</CODE> function will read a text file that contains columns of
numbers. In this instance the file looks like:

<H3>Basic Math Operations</H3>

<P>
<P>The basic mathematical operators: <CODE>+,-,*,/</CODE> work on numeric
objects of any dimension. If the operands are scalars, then the
operations are performed as expected:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> 2 + 3
        5  
> 2 - 3
       -1  
> 2 * 3
        6  
> 2 / 3
    0.667  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If either of the operands have dimensions higher than one, then
array or matrix operations are performed. Array operations act in an
element-by-element sense. That is, the scalar value is used
repeatedley to perform the operation on each element of the
array. For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> a+2
        3          4          5  
        6          7          8  
        9         10         11

       14         16         18  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When both operands are matrices, then matrix operations are
performed, provided the dimensions of the operands are
appropriate. For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

<H3>Basic Tools</H3>

<P>
<P>In addition to the basic mathematical operators, there are many
functions designed to operate efficiently on arrays. Most of the
functionality these functions provide could be performed with fairly
simple algorithms written in the Rlab language. However, these
functions are written in the C-language (a compiled language), and
are optimized for operations on arrays. Generally, using these
functions will produce programs with good performance, and a minimum
of effort. Generally, there are three types of functions: scalar,
vector, and matrix.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Scalar Functions:</B><DD><P>These functions operate on scalar
values, and treat arrays (matrices) in an element-by-element
fashion. For example, the function <CODE>abs</CODE> will return the
absolute value of an object (provided it is a numeric
object). If the object is scalar in size, the result is
scalar. If the object is an array, either a vector or a matrix,
then the result is an array of the same size, with each
element representing the absolute value of the corresponding
element of the input array.
<P>
<DT><B>Vector Functions:</B><DD><P>These functions operate on either row
(1-by-N), or column (N-by-1) vectors. If the argument is an
array with dimensions N-by-M, then the operation is performed
on the M columns of the input.
<P>
<DT><B>Matrix Functions:</B><DD><P>These function operate on matrices as a
single entity. These functions may return a scalar, a vector,
another matrix, or any combination. For example, the function
<CODE>det</CODE> returns a scalar value, while <CODE>eig</CODE> returns a
matrix (the eigenvectors), and a vector (the eigenvalues).
</DL>
<P>Using the matrices created in the previous section we will
demonstrate some of the most frequently used functions.
<P>The matrix <CODE>m</CODE> has been termed a "magic square" matrix by
some. The name is due to the properties of the matrix. First of all,
its elements are integers from 1 to N squared (N is the dimension of
the matrix). The sum of each row, the sum of each column, and the
sum of the diagonal elements are all the same. These properties can
be displayed very simply with the help of some functions.

<H3>Linear Algebra</H3>

<P>
<P>Rlab contains a high-level interfaces to the LAPACK (Linear Algebra
PACKage), the FFTPACK (Fast Fourier Transform PACKage), and the
RANLIB (RANdom number LIBrary) libraries. These interfaces can
simplify many, otherwise difficult programming tasks. For example,
we might be interested in solving a system of equations. Using the
magic-square matrix once again

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The function <CODE>rcond</CODE> estimates the reciprocal of the matrix
condition number. A value of 6.7 indicates that the magic-square
matrix is reasonably well conditioned (full-rank). Next, we use the
<CODE>solve</CODE> function, to get the solution to the system of
equations with coefficients of the magic-square, and right-hand
sides of unity. Lastly, we check the result by mulitplying the
coefficient matrix by the solution vector (<CODE>m*x</CODE>) and
subtracting the right-hand side. The result should be a zero-vector
(and it is).
<P>Note that there are other ways to solve a system of equations. The
<CODE>\</CODE> operator (see Section 
<A HREF="rlab-ref-3.html#arithmetic-ops">Arithmetic Operations</A>) could be used like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> x = m\ones(5,1)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Or, the <CODE>inv</CODE> function could be used. However, using <CODE>inv</CODE>
is usually a bad idea.
<P>In addition to the linear-algebra functions supplied to solve
systems of equations, there are numerous others such as <CODE>eig</CODE>
for solving eigenvalue problems, and <CODE>qr</CODE> for performing QR
decomposition, and <CODE>svd</CODE> for performing the singular value
decomposition.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Computing the Mean</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This example is fairly long, but it does cover allot of ground.  For
this example it is assumed that there exist data in a file, for
which you want to know some statistics. In this case, the mean or
average, and the standard deviation. The file looks like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

6        30
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  
<P>The students are identified with an integer (the first column). To
read this data, and compute the mean or average test score is
simple. The <CODE>readm</CODE> function is used to get the data from the
file. The contents of the file are read, and assigned to the matrix
<CODE>grades</CODE>.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

       71  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  
<P>The function <CODE>sum</CODE> sums the column of a matrix, and is used
here to look at the sums of both columns. However, only the average
of the second column is desired. The following statement singles out
the second column of <CODE>grades</CODE>, uses it as an argument to
<CODE>sum</CODE>, and divides the result by the number of rows in
<CODE>grades</CODE>. 
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Computing the Mean Again</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>A more complicated version (only at first glance) of the 
problems is created when the professor wants to eliminate numeric
identification of each student and use their names instead. This
file consists of student's names in the first column, and grades in
the second column.

<P>Although the file format is simple, many programs/languages would
have difficulty handling the mixture of string and numeric
data. Rlab has a list-object which allows for convenient association
of numeric and string data. Lists are N-dimensional arrays that are
indexed associatively. With the list we can create elements that are
indexed with the student's name. Each element will then contain the
student's grade. For example: <CODE>grade.Alice</CODE> will contain
Alice's grade of 73. First the data must be read and the array
<CODE>grade</CODE> created.

<P>The previous four lines of code may look at little complex, but is
really quite simple, taken one step at a time. Starting with the
getline function call: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
line = getline("mean_std.ex")
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  
<P>The <CODE>getline</CODE> function takes a filename as argument, reads one
line, and splits it into numbers and strings. The data are returned
as a list, with the first element containing the data in the first
field, the second element containing the data in the second field
and so on. When <CODE>getline</CODE> can't read anymore information from
the file it returns a list with zero length. To read from a file,
until the end we use:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
length(line = getline("mean_std.ex")) != 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  
<P>inside a <CODE>while</CODE> statement. The <CODE>while</CODE> statement executes
until the condition is false (zero). Thus, when the end-of-file is
reached, and <CODE>getline</CODE> returns a zero-length list, the
while-loop will terminate. The statement inside the while-loop:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    grade.[line.[1]] = line.[2];
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
  
<P>creates a list-variable named <CODE>grade</CODE>. Each element of grade
is a student's grade. These elements are indexed with the student's
name. Remember, <CODE>getline</CODE> returns a list containing the
whitespace separated fields of each line, so: <CODE>line.[1]</CODE> is the
first field, or the student's name in each line, and <CODE>line.[2]</CODE>
is the second field, or the student's grade in each line. The result
is a list. We can see the list indices by typing the list-variable's
name at the prompt, and we can see the contents of a list element by
using the appropriate list index.

<P>Figure XX shows the

can ignore the <CODE>plgrid</CODE>, <CODE>pltitle</CODE>, <CODE>xlabel</CODE>, and
<CODE>ylabel</CODE> statements; they merely server to add window dressing
to the displayed plot. The <CODE>plot</CODE> takes a matrix as an
argument, and plots columns two through the last versus the first
column. So, the first column is <CODE>t</CODE>, the independent variable,
The second column is <CODE>b</CODE>, the experimental data, and the last
column is the result of the least-squares fit of the data. The
matrix is formed by stacking the three individual row-vectors on top
of one another, then transposing the entire matrix so that in the
