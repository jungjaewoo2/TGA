      [1mDescription[0m
        Open will open a file or a pipe for read or write operations.
        Open allows the user to specify the mode of operation, and
        optionally a buffer-size for I/O. The "normal" UNIX modes are:


        [1mr  [22mread access

        [1mw  [22mwrite access

        [1ma  [22mappend: open for writing at end of file, or create for
           writing


        [4mBUFFSIZE[0m
           Buffersize is specified in bytes. If BUFFSIZE  is not
           specified the system defaults are used.

        Other operating systems may have different mode keys. Look at
        the API documentation for fopen on your system to find what mode
        values are acceptable.
