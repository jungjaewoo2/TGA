      [1mDescription[0m
        Solve solves a system of linear equations:


          [4mA[24m [4m*[24m [4mX[24m [4m=[24m [4mB[0m



        [4mA[24m  is the coefficient matrix.

        [4mB[24m  is the right hand side.

        [4mX[24m  is the solution.

     [4mB[24m can contain multiple right-hand-sides, one in each column.  Solve
     returns a matrix of the solutions, [4mX[24m, where each column of the
     solution corresponds to a column of [4mB[24m.

     Solve uses the LAPACK subroutines DGETRF, and ZGETRF if [4mA[24m is
     general.

     Solve uses the LAPACK subroutines DSYTRF, and ZHETRF if [4mA[24m is
     symmetric.

     The third and optional argument, [4mTYPE[24m allows the user to overide
     the symmetry check, and force the solve to use either the general
     or the symmetric solver.


          TYPE = "g" or "G":      The general solution is used.



          TYPE = "s" or "S":      The symmetric solution is used.
