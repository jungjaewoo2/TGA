      [1mDescription[0m
        Strsplt returns a row matrix that contains a single character
        string as each element. The resulting matrix has as many columns
        as the input argument had characters.

        Example:



          > smat = strsplt( "string" )
           smat =
          s  t  r  i  n  g
          > show(smat)
             name:      smat
             class:     matrix
             type:      string
               nr:      1
               nc:      6




     The second, and optional, argument to strsplt, [4mFW[24m forces strsplt to
     split [4mSTR[24m into [4mFW[24m length strings.

     [4mFW[24m can also be a string, or a string matrix, specifying the field
     separators that strsplt will use:



          > str = "this;is;a;sem-colon;separated string;with numbers;1.234"
          this;is;a;sem-colon;separated string;with numbers;1.234

          > strsplt(str,";")
          this              is                a                 sem-colon

          separated string  with numbers      1.234
