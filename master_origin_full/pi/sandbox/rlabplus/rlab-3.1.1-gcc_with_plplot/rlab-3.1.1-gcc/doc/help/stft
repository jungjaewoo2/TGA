      [1mDescription[0m
        stft utilizes the FFTPACK subroutine CFFTF to compute a windowed
        discrete forward Fourier transform of the signal [4mX[24m, where the
        window is provided as [4mW[24m.

        If fft is used with the third argument, [4mFMAX[24m, then the short
        time fourier transform, that would otherwise be of the length of
        the signal [4mX[24m, is truncated to [4mFMAX[24m.

        Subroutine CFFTF computes the forward complex discrete Fourier
        transform (the Fourier analysis). equivalently , CFFTF computes
        the Fourier coefficients of a complex periodic sequence.

        The argument [4mX[24m must be a single signal - vector, while the
        argument [4mW[24m has to be a real vector.  It is required that the
        length of signal is greater than the length of the window, and
        that [4mFMAX[24m       is greater than the window length as well.
