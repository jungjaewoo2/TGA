      [1mDescription[0m
        Tic internally marks the time at which it was invoked. To
        measure elapsed time, use tic in conjunction with toc.

        Example:


          tic();
          a = rand(100,100);
          eig(a);
          toc()




     The above would measure the time spent generating the 100x100
     random matrix, and calculating the eigenvectors and values.
