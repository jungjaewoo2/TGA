      [1mDescription[0m
        Reshape does what its name implies, it reshapes the input matrix
        so that the return value has the number of rows and columns
        specified by the last two arguments. Reshape will not reshape
        the matrix if the product of the new row and column dimensions
        does not equal the product of the existing row and column
        dimensions.

        Examples:



          m = [1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9];
          mrow = reshape(m, 1, 9); // converts m to a row matrix
          mcol = reshape(m, 9, 1); // converts m to a column matrix
