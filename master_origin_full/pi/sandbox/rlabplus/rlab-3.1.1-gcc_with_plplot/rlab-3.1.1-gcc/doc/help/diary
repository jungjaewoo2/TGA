      [1mDescription[0m
        The diary function echoes all input commands and Rlab output to
        a diary file. If [4mFILENAME[24m is not specified, then a file named:
        DIARY is opened.

        The diary, used without any arguments will turn on statement
        logging, or turn off statement logging if a diary file is
        already open.
