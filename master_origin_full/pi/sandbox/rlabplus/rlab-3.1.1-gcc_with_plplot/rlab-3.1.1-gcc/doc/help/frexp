        frexp ( [4mA[24m )

      [1mDescription[0m
        Frexp returns a list with elements [4mf[24m and [4me[24m Frexp splits [4mA[24m into a
        normalized fraction in the interval:



                          0.5 <= abs(f) <= 1





     which is returned in [4mf[24m, and a power of 2, which is returned in [4me[24m.
     If [4mA[24m is zero, then both [4me[24m and [4mf[24m are zero.

     Frexp operates on REAL matrices of any dimension.
