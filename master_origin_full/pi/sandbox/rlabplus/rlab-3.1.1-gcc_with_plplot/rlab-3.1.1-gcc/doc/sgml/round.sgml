<tag> Description </tag>

	Round returns the nearest integer value to its floating point
	argument <em>X</> as a double-precision floating point
	number. The returned value is rounded according to the
	currently set machine rounding mode. If round-to-nearest (the
	default mode) is set and the difference between the function
	argument and the rounded result is exactly 0.5, then the
	result will be rounded to the nearest even integer.

	Round uses the libm.a function rint. If your machine does not
	have rint, then the supplied rint is used.
