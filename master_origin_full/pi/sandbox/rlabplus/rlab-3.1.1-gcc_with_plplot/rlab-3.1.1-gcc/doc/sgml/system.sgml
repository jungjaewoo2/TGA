<tag> Description </tag>

	The system function behaves like the the UNIX system call. The
	string argument to system, <em>COMMAND</>, is passed directly
	to the bourne-shell for execution. The program waits until the
	system call is finished.

	Example:
<tscreen><verb>
> system( "vi test.r" )
</verb></tscreen>

	will allow the user to edit (create) the file
	<tt>test.r</>. When the vi process is finished the user will
	be back at the RLaB prompt.

<tscreen><verb>
> rfile test
</verb></tscreen>

	will then load the result of the vi process.
