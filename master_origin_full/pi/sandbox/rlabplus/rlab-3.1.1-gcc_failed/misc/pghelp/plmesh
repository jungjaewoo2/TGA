plmesh:

Synopsis: Plot a 3-dimensional mesh

Syntax: plmesh ( X, Y, Z, THETA, PHI, AXIS )

Description:

	plmesh takes two vectors, and a matrix of Z-values to plot a
	mesh. 

		X	The x-axis values, a vector with number of
			elements equal to the number of rows of z.

		Y	The y-axis values, a vector with number of
			elements equal to the number of column of z.

		Z	A rectangular matrix, z[i;j] = f(x[i],y[j])


	THETA   Defaults to 60 degrees. The angle (in degrees) of
                rotation about the Z-axis.

	PHI     Defaults to 35 degrees. The angle (in degrees) of
                rotation about the X-axis.

        AXIS    If AXIS is TRUE (1), then the 3 orthogonal axes will
                be drawn. Axis-1: [1, 0, 0], Axis-2: [0, 1, 0],
                Axis-3: [0, 0, 1].  The axes are scaled to the plot
                window. 

        There are only two rotations for the user to specify.  They
        rotate the mesh relative to the "eye".  The first rotation
        (THETA) rotates the mesh about the Z-axis.  You can imagine
        looking down on a table, the top of the table being the
        mesh. THETA rotations rotate the table about an axis parallel
        to the legs.  PHI rotations rotate the mesh about the X-axis,
        or an axis perpendicular to the legs of the table.
