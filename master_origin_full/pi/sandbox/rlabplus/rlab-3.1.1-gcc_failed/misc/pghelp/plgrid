plgrid:

Synopsis: Set the grid type for the current sub-plot.

Syntax: plgrid ( GRID_STY_X , GRID_STY_Y )

Description:

	Set the grid type for the current sub-plot in the curent
	plot-window. The grid type is specified by a string. The
	possible elements of the string are described below. The
	string can include any combination of the following letters
	(lower case) in any order. If plgrid is called without any
	arguments, the defaults (X-axis: "bcnst", Y-axis: "bcnstv")
	are reset.  

          A : draw Axis (X axis is horizontal line Y=0, Y axis is vertical
              line X=0).
          B : draw bottom (X) or left (Y) edge of frame.
          C : draw top (X) or right (Y) edge of frame.
          G : draw Grid of vertical (X) or horizontal (Y) lines.
          I : Invert the tick marks; ie draw them outside the viewport
              instead of inside.
          L : label axis Logarithmically (see below).
          N : write Numeric labels in the conventional location below the
              viewport (X) or to the left of the viewport (Y).
          P : extend ("Project") major tick marks outside the box (ignored if
              option I is specified).
          M : write numeric labels in the unconventional location above the
              viewport (X) or to the right of the viewport (Y).
          T : draw major Tick marks at the major coordinate interval.
          S : draw minor tick marks (Subticks).
          V : orient numeric labels Vertically. This is only applicable to Y.
              The default is to write Y-labels parallel to the axis.
          1 : force decimal labelling, instead of automatic choice.
          2 : force exponential labelling, instead of automatic.

	Example - Set X and Y logarithmic scales:

		plgrid ( "bcgnstl", "bcgnstlv")
