Syntax: plaz ( AZ )

Description:

	Set the "azimuth" for the current sub-plot in the current
	plot-window. Azimuth represents the viewing angle in degrees.
	When AZ=0, the observer is looking face onto the ZX plane, and
	as AZ is increased, the  observer moves clockwise around the
	box when viewed from above the XY plane. Only affects 3D
	plots.
