<tag> Description </tag>

	The require command takes Rfile names as operands, and checks
	the workspace for a function variable called <em>NAME</>. If
	that function exists, then no action is taken. If the function
	does not exist, then the file <tt>NAME.r</> is loaded.

	More than one <em>NAME</> can be given on the same
	line. Continuations are not allowed.

	<em>NAME</> can contain the `.r' extension that distinguishes
	Rfiles (by convention), or <em>NAME</> can omit the `.r'
	extension. In either case a workspace variable without the
	`.r' extension is checked for.

	Example:

<tscreen><verb>
> require roots poly.r bode
</verb></tscreen>

	The require command syntax is identical to the rfile command,
	with the obvious exception of the initial keyword.

	The rules for searching the user's <tt>RLAB2_PATH</> are the
	same as those used with the rfile command.
