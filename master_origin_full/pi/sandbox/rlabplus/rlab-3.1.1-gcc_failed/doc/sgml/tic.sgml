<tag> Description </tag>

	Tic internally marks the time at which it was invoked. To
	measure elapsed time, use tic in conjunction with toc.

	Example:
<tscreen><verb>
tic();
a = rand(100,100);
eig(a);
toc()
</verb></tscreen>

	The above would measure the time spent generating the 100x100
	random matrix, and calculating the eigenvectors and values.
