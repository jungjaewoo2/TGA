<tag> Description </tag>

isinf returns TRUE (1) if <em>A</> is Infinity (according to
IEEE-754). If <em>A</> is a vector or a matrix the test is
performed element-by-element, and a matrix the same size as
<em>A</> is returned.

Infs can usually be created by attempting to divide by zero,
or using the builtin inf function.

	Example:
<tscreen><verb>
> a = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, inf(); 7, 8, 9]
 a =
        1          2          3  
        4          5        inf  
        7          8          9  
> isinf (a)
        0          0          0  
        0          0          1  
        0          0          0
