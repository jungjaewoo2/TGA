	RLaB trigonometric functions are designed to take scalars, and
	matrices as arguments. The return value is the input argument
	with the trigonometric operation performed element by element.

	All the trigonometric functions use the C language math
	library functions, so details about the ranges and error
	conditions can be found by examining the appropriate man pages
	on your system.
