<tag> Description </tag>
	
	The write function takes at least two arguments. The 1st
	argument is the string that identifies the file to write to.
	The file is opened with write permission, destroying any
	pre-existing contents. The file is left open so that
	subsequent writes will append to the file, and not destroy the
	contents.

	The arguments after the file name are the objects that will
	be written. All objects are written in RLaB binary format.

	Example:

<tscreen><verb>
writeb ( "filename", a , b , c );
</verb></tscreen>

	Will open the file named <tt>filename</> in write mode, and
	write the contents of the variables <tt>a</>, <tt>b</>, and
	<tt>c</>.

	The matrix format that write uses is compatible with MATLAB's
	matrix format. As long as the file only contains matrices,
	MATLAB should be able to read RLaB binary output.
