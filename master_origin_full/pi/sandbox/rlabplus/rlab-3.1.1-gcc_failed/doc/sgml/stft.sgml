<tag> Description </tag>

	stft utilizes the FFTPACK subroutine CFFTF to compute a
	windowed discrete forward Fourier transform of the signal <em>X</>,
	where the window is provided as <em>W</>.

	If fft is used with the third argument, <em>FMAX</>, then the
	short time fourier transform, that would otherwise be of the length
	of the signal <em>X</em>, is truncated to <em>FMAX</em>.

	Subroutine CFFTF computes the forward complex discrete Fourier
	transform (the Fourier analysis). equivalently , CFFTF
	computes the Fourier coefficients of a complex periodic
	sequence.

	The argument <em>X</> must be a single signal - vector,
	while the argument <em>W</em> has to be a real vector.
	It is required that the length of signal is greater than the
	length of the window, and that <em>FMAX</em>	is greater than
	the window length as well.
