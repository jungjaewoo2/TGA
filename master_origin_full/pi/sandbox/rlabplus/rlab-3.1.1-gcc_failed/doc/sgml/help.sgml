	<tag>help</tag> Prints a list of available help files. Help
		first prints out the help files in the default help
		file directory. Next, the directories identified in
		the environment variable <tt>RLAB_SEARCH_PATH</> are
		searched for files ending in `.r' -- rfiles. A list of
		each directory's rfiles is printed on the standard
		output.
	       
	<tag>help <em>NAME</></tag> Prints out the help file
		identified by <em>NAME</>. If <em>NAME</> matches a
		file in the default help directory, that file is paged
		to the standard output. If no match is found, the
		directories identified in the environment variable
		<tt>RLAB_SEARCH_PATH</> are searched for matches. The
		first match is paged to the standard output. The rfile
		extension (`.r') is not considered when checking for
		matches.

	If the user's environment does not contain
	<tt>RLAB_SEARCH_PATH</>, then the default search-path is
	used. The default is set at compile time. Normally the default
	is ".", the current working directory.

	Help is a command, not an expression or statement. Therefore,
	it must be issued on a line by itself, and cannot occur in the
	midst of another statement or expression.
