        diag ( [4mA[24m )

        diag ( [4mA[24m, [4mK[24m )

      [1mDescription[0m
        If the 1st argument, [4mA[24m is a 1xN matrix construct a diagonal
        matrix from the input. Optionally if [4mK[24m (scalar) is specified
        then create a matrix with the vector as the [4mK[24mth diagonal.

        If the 1st argument is a MxN matrix, construct a 1xN matrix from
        the diagonal elements of the input matrix. Optionally if [4mK[24m is
        specified return the vector from the [4mK[24mth diagonal of the input
        matrix.


          [4mK[24m < is below the main diagonal.



          [4mK[24m > is above the main diagonal.
