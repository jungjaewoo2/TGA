        The RLaB printf is a limited feature version of the C-language
        printf(). The features are limited because RLaB does not support
        all of the data type the C-language does.

           must be a valid printf format string


        [4mVARi[0m
           are any number of constants or variables that match the
           format string. printf cannot print out vector, matrix, or
           list objects as a whole. Valid print objects are strings,
           constants, and scalars.

        The following shows how one might print out the annotated
        contents of a matrix.



          for(i in 0:size(a)[0]-1)
          {
            for(j in 0:size(a)[1]-1)
            {
              printf("a[%i;%i] = %f\n", i, j, a[i;j]);
            }
          }





     However, it would be more efficient to use:



          > writem("stdout", a);
