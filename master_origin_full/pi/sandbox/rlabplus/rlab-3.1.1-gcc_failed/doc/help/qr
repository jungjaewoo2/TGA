      [1mDescription[0m

        Qr computes the QR decomposition of the input matrix A such
        that:


          A = Q * R


     or


          A*p = Q * R


     Qr returns a list containing elements [4mq[24m and [4mr[24m. Optionally, qr can
     take a second argument, "p" which tells qr to perform column
     pivoting when computing [4mq[24m and [4mr[24m. The permutation matrix [4mp[24m is
     returned in the same list as [4mq[24m and [4mr[24m.

     Qr utilizes LAPACK subroutines DGEQRF and DORGQR for REAL inputs,
     and ZGEQRF and ZUNGQR for COMPLEX inputs. When column pivoting is
     requested the LAPACK subroutines DGEQPF, and ZGEQPF are used.
