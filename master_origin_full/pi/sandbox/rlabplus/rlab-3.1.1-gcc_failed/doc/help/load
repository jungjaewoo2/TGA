      [1mDescription[0m
        Load opens the file named [4mfilename[24m and reads its contents as
        though a user were typing the contents at the command line. Thus
        a user can use load to enter data, user-functions, or execute
        repetitive commands saved in a file. there is no limit to the
        number of functions, or regular statements that can exist in a
        file called by load.

        Immediately after the the input is read, load closes the file,
        so that subsequent calls to load will re-open the file.

        Load requires that a complete file specification be provided.
        If the file is in the present working directory, then only the
        filename is necessary otherwise, a complete path is required.

        In most cases the rfile command is simpler to use.

        Example:


          // load the roots() function into memory
          > load( "roots.r" )
