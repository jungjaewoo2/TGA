        The spwrite function takes at least two arguments. The 1st
        argument is the string that identifies the file to write to.
        The file is opened with write permission, destroying any pre-
        existing contents. The file closed after the matrix is written.

        The default format for the sparse matrix is the internal storage
        format: compressed row-wise storage. See the Rlab Reference
        Manual for more explanation of this storage format.

        A third, and optional argument, is a string specifying either
        the default, or an optional output format. The value of the
        string can be either "sparse" (default) or "graph". The graph
        output is a file suitable for use with the Metis or Chaco graph
        partitioning/re-ordering software.
