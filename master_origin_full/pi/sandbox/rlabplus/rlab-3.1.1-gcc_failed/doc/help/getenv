      [1mDescription[0m
        Getenv searches the current environment for a variable with name
        [4mNAME[24m. The value of the environment variable is returned as a
        string.

        Exactly how getenv behaves is depends upon the underlying
        operating system implementation. On UNIX system getenv will
        return a NULL string if the environment variable does not exist.
