  Builtin Function



      [1mSynopsis[0m
        Read data from a file.

      [1mSyntax[0m
        read ( [4mFILENAME[24m )

        read ( [4mFILENAME[24m, [4mLIST[24m )

      [1mDescription[0m
        read reads the file identified by the [4mFILENAME[24m. The file is
        opened with read access, and all of the contents are read.  The
        file identified by the 1st argument must contain data that is in
        RLaB binary format.  The entities in the file are installed in
        the global symbol table, overwriting any existing entities. Upon
        completion the file is closed.

        Example:



          read ("bunch_of_data_in_a_file");





     The second form of the read function allows the data in the file to
     be read into list variable [4mLIST[24m. The global-symbol-table is
     untouched (except for [4mLIST[24m).

     Example:



          read ("bunch_of_data", X);





     The contents of the file bunch_of_data are read and stored in the
     list variable X. Except for the creation/modification of the
     variable X, the global-symbol-table is unchanged.

     Read will read most numeric matrices written by MATLAB's save
     command. Read will not read MATLAB text matrices, or sparse
     matrices, or matrices written with reduced precision (integer
     format). Read will not read Cray, or VAX binaries. Read will read
     big and little endian binaries - this includes binaries written
     from PCs, DEC Risc, Macintosh, Sun, and Apollo.
