        mod( [4mA[24m, [4mB[24m )

      [1mDescription[0m
        The mod routine returns the floating point remainder of the
        division of [4mA[24m by [4mB[24m: zero if [4mB[24m is zero or if [4mA[24m/[4mB[24m would overflow;
        otherwise the number F with the same sign as [4mA[24m, such that [4mA[24m = i[4mB[0m
        + F for some integer i, and |f| < |B|.

        When the arguments to mod are two matrices, then an element by
        element mod is performed. Mod works on complex number also.

        mod(x,y) is equivalent to:

          n = int( x/y )



          mod(x,y) = x - y.*n


     mod is implemented via libm.a fmod function.
