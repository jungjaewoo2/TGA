      [1mDescription[0m


        [1mrfile[0m
           Prints a list of all the files with a `.r' suffix. The list
           is compiled by searching the directories contained in the
           environment variable RLAB2__PATH.


        [1mrfile [4m[22mNAME[0m
           Loads the contents of the file denoted by [4mNAME[24m into the
           workspace. The [4mNAME[24m argument is NOT a string, and does not
           have to include the `.r' suffix.

           Allowable names for rfiles are filenames that start with:

             A digit, or a letter (a-z or A-Z).


        and contain:


             digits, letters, and/or -, _, .


        You may not be able to use all the possible filenames allowed by
        the host operating system.


        If the user's environment does not contain RLAB2_PATH, then the
        default search-path is used. The default is set at compile time.
        Normally the default is ".", the current working directory.

        Rfile is a command, not an expression or statement. Therefore,
        it must be issued on a line by itself, and cannot occur in the
        midst of another statement or expression.  The rfile command
        cannot be continued across lines (no continuations).

        The command `rfile [4mNAME[24m' can be used more than once. Each time
        the command is issued the file `[4mNAME[24m.r' is loaded.

        The rfile command tries to be friendly. If you give it a string
        without the `.r' extension, it will automatically add one for
        you. If you give is a string with the `.r' extension, it will
        leave it alone.

        The contents of the named file can be any valid RLaB commands or
        functions. There is no limit to the number of functions that a
        file can contain. Additionally, a mixture of commands, and
        function definitions can be included in the same file.

        Example:

          > rfile roots.r poly bode
