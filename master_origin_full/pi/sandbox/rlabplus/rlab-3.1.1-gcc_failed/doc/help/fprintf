      [1mDescription[0m
        The RLaB fprintf is a limited feature version of the C-language
        fprintf. The features are limited because RLaB does not support
        all of the data types the C-language does.

           The 1st string argument determines the file to which the
           output is sent. If the filename starts with a | then a pipe
           is opened to the process following the | and the output is
           written to the pipe. For example:



             > fprintf("|gnuplot"; "set term X11\n plot sin(x)\n");




        will create the sub-process gnuplot, and pipe the command string
        to it.

           A valid fprintf format string.


        [4mVARi[0m
           Are any number of constants or variables that match the
           format string. fprintf cannot print out vector, matrix, or
           list objects as a whole. Valid print objects are strings,
           constants, and scalars.


        Example:


          > for (i in 1:a.n) { fprintf("stdout", "element %i: %20.10g\n", i, a[i]); }
          element 1:          1.414213562
          element 2:          4.242640687
          element 3:          2.828427125
          element 4:          5.656854249
