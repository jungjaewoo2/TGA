1. rlabplus does not compile well on gfortran: gfortran cannot yet build pgplot package,
because the compiler does not handle %VAL and such statements. For that reason, the rlab
has to be built without pgplot interface:
  > rm config.cache
  > ./configure --without-pgplot
Please note, all the fortran libraries have already been built with gfortran. This is easily
verified by checking their makefile's.
