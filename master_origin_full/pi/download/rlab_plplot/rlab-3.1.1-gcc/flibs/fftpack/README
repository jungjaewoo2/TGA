	The routines in this directory are from netlib/bihar.
	Although, they look like they are derivitaves of the following
	package.

	The Fortran files have been translated to the C-language with
	f2c, which is also available from netlib.
	
	Note: Actually the version of fftpack on netlib is slightly
	different. This version is a double-precision version. If you
	want to compile it with a Fortran compiler (the original
	source), either use IMPLICIT statements, or get the Fortran
	source from: netlib/bihar

	The command used to generate the C source was `f2c *.f'

	To make:

	1) Type `./configure'

	The options configure will recognize:

	--with-prefix=install_prefix_pathname

	--with-cc=full_cc_pathname
	--with-ld=full_ld_pathname
	--with-ar=full_ar_pathname
	--with-ranlib=full_ranlib_pathname

	These options are designed to allow users to specify alternate
	programs to use so that cross compiling can be performed. If
	you are compiling this library for a native platform then you
	should not need to specify any options.

	2.) Type `make'

	3.) Type `make -n install'

	The default installation directory is `/usr/local/lib'. If you
	wish to install the library in another directory the do:
	
		make -n install prefix=/usr/wherever/lib

	3a) If you are satisfied with the "make install" command
	output, then retype the command without the `-n'.
