<tag> Description </tag>

<tt>reads( )</tt> reads input from keyboard until `return' is pressed.
<tt>reads( <em>filename</em> )</tt> reads the content of the file in a single
column string vector. If the <em>filename</em>  begins with `|' then the
reading is performed from the pipe. The latter is the
<tt>modus operandi</tt> of many functions in RLaB2 Rel. 2 that communicate
 with shell, e.g., see dir, ls, email, md5sum etc. For example,
<tscreen><verb>
ys = reads  (`my_file_with_lots_of_data');
y  = strtod (ys);
</verb></tscreen>
Or, another example where a pipe to shell command is used,
<tscreen><verb>
fns = reads  (`| ls -1A');
for (fn in fns)
{
  printf (`Found file: ');
  printf (`%s', fn);
}
</verb></tscreen>
