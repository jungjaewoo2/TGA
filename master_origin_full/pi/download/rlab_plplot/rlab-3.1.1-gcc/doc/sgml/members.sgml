<tag> Description </tag>

	The members function takes a variable as an argument
	(<em>L</>), and returns a string-vector containing the
	object's member names.

	For example: <tt>x = members (&dollar;&dollar;)</tt> will
	create a row-vector and assign it to <em>x</>. The row-vector
	will contain the names of all the elements in the
	global-symbol-table.

	The members function is probably most useful when used in
	conjunction with for-loops. The result of members can be
	used as the loop index, allowing users to operate on the
	elements of an object. For example:

<tscreen><verb>
ll = << a = rand(3,3); b = rand(3,3); c = rand(3,3) >>;
for (i in members (ll)) { ll.[i] = diag(ll.[i]); }
</verb></tscreen>
