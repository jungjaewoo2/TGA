        c = polyfit ( [4mY[24m, [4mX[24m/, [4moptions[24m/ )


        Arguments:

        [4mY[24m[1m, [4m[22mX[0m
           ordinatae and abscisae of the data points which are fitted to
           a polynomial.

        [4moptions[24m [1m=<< maxdeg;f;error >>[0m
           [4mmaxdeg[24m is the maximal degree of polynomial being sought,
           where the degree must be  smaller than the number of given
           points.  The criterion for the fit is given either in terms
           of f-statistics threshold, as [4mf[24m [4m=[24m [4m0.01,[24m [4m0.05,[24m [4m0.1[24m, or through
           absolute error criterion in terms of [4merror[24m.

        Result:

        [4mc[24m [1m= << coef;error;degree >>[0m
           with [4mcoef[24m being the coefficients of the best fit polynomial,
           [4mdegree[24m its degree and [4merror[24m the maximal error in the
           coefficients.

        The solver is built upon a fortran routine DPOLFT from the
        SLATEC library.
