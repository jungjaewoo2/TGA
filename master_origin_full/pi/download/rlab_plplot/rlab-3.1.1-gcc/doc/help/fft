      [1mDescription[0m
        Fft utilizes the FFTPACK subroutine CFFTF to compute a discrete
        forward Fourier transform of the input.

        If fft is used with a second argument, [4mN[24m, then the matrix [4mX[24m is
        either padded with zeros, or truncated till it is of length [4mN[0m
        (if [4mX[24m is a vector), or has row dimension [4mN[24m (if it is a matrix).

        Subroutine CFFTF computes the forward complex discrete Fourier
        transform (the Fourier analysis). equivalently , CFFTF computes
        the Fourier coefficients of a complex periodic sequence.



                  for j=1,...,n

                     c(j)=the sum from k=1,...,n of

                           c(k)*exp(-i*(j-1)*(k-1)*2*pi/n)

                                 where i=sqrt(-1)





     The argument [4mX[24m must be a matrix. If [4mX[24m is a row, or column matrix
     then a vector fft is performed. If [4mX[24m is a MxN matrix then the [4mN[0m
     columns of [4mX[24m are fft'ed.
