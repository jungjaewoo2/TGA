      [1mDescription[0m
        The require command takes Rfile names as operands, and checks
        the workspace for a function variable called [4mNAME[24m. If that
        function exists, then no action is taken. If the function does
        not exist, then the file NAME.r is loaded.

        More than one [4mNAME[24m can be given on the same line. Continuations
        are not allowed.

        [4mNAME[24m can contain the `.r' extension that distinguishes Rfiles
        (by convention), or [4mNAME[24m can omit the `.r' extension. In either
        case a workspace variable without the `.r' extension is checked
        for.

        Example:



          > require roots poly.r bode




     The require command syntax is identical to the rfile command, with
     the obvious exception of the initial keyword.

     The rules for searching the user's RLAB2_PATH are the same as those
     used with the rfile command.
