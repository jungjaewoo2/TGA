        max ( [4mA[24m )

        max ( [4mA[24m, [4mB[24m )

      [1mDescription[0m
        Max returns the maximum value(s) contained in the matrix [4mA[24m. If
        the argument is a vector, then the largest value is returned.
        If [4mA[24m is a MxN matrix, then a row-vector of N columns is returned
        containing the maximum value from each column of [4mA[24m.

        If max is used with two arguments, then max returns a matrix the
        same size as [4mA[24m and [4mB[24m filled with the largest elements from [4mA[24m and
        [4mB[24m.

        When matrix elements are complex the absolute value is used for
        comparison purposes.
