        close ( [4mfilename[24m )

      [1mDescription[0m
        close takes a string ([4mfilename[24m) as input, and attempts to close
        the output stream associated with [4mfilename[24m. close returns TRUE
        (1) if the output stream was successfully closed, FALSE (0) if
        the output stream could not be closed.

        If you want to read the contents of a file that you have created
        with the write function in the present session, then be sure to
        close the file before using the read function.

        Example:


          write( "eig_output", a , vec , val );
          close( "eig_output" );
          read( "eig_output" );
