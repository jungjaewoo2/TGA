        RLaB trigonometric functions are designed to take scalars, and
        matrices as arguments. The return value is the input argument
        with the trigonometric operation performed element by element.

        All the trigonometric functions use the C language math library
        functions, so details about the ranges and error conditions can
        be found by examining the appropriate man pages on your system.
