           Prints a list of available help files. Help first prints out
           the help files in the default help file directory. Next, the
           directories identified in the environment variable
           RLAB_SEARCH_PATH are searched for files ending in `.r' --
           rfiles. A list of each directory's rfiles is printed on the
           standard output.


        [1mhelp [4m[22mNAME[0m
           Prints out the help file identified by [4mNAME[24m. If [4mNAME[24m matches
           a file in the default help directory, that file is paged to
           the standard output. If no match is found, the directories
           identified in the environment variable RLAB_SEARCH_PATH are
           searched for matches. The first match is paged to the
           standard output. The rfile extension (`.r') is not considered
           when checking for matches.


        If the user's environment does not contain RLAB_SEARCH_PATH,
        then the default search-path is used. The default is set at
        compile time. Normally the default is ".", the current working
        directory.

        Help is a command, not an expression or statement. Therefore, it
        must be issued on a line by itself, and cannot occur in the
        midst of another statement or expression.
