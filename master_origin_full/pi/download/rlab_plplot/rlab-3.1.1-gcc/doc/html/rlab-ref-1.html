<P>
<P>Rlab stands for ``our'' lab. It is available to almost everyone who
needs a computational tool for scientific and engineering
applications, because it is freely available, and it runs on many
platforms.
<P>For many years scientists and engineers have developed and
implemented programs in low-level programming languages such as
Algol, Fortran, Pascal, and C. As computers get faster, and more
people program them, high level languages have become more
popular. Most high level languages are tailored towards a
particular task, or class of tasks, this is not a shortcoming, but
a direct consequence of the high level nature of a language. If a
language is supposed to be easy, convenient, for a particular set
of tasks, some assumptions about those tasks must be made. There is
a cost associated with the assumptions made with any high level
language. In the realm of scientific languages the price is usually
slower program execution time. However, as tasks become more
complex, and computers get faster, the penalty for slower execution
time is less. Often the slower execution time is more than
compensated for by the significantly reduced development time.
<P>Rlab, a high level language for engineers and scientists makes
several assumptions:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The user is interested in computational exercises. Rlab
offers little if any convenience for those who need help with
symbolic programming.
   </LI>
<LI> The operations, and conventions of linear algebra are useful
in accomplishing most tasks. Rlab offers simple access to the
most popular linear algebra libraries, BLAS, and
LAPACK. Furthermore, Rlab's basic data structures are matrix
oriented, with the vector dot-product an integral part of
the built-in operations.

Due to the array oriented operations, and the high-level
interface to FFTPACK, and a discrete IIR filtering function,
Rlab servers well as an environment for signal analysis and
exploration. 
</LI>
<LI> The language should be simple, yet predictable, with its
origins in popular scientific languages that most
engineers/scientists are likely to already be familiar
with. Thus, Rlab takes after the C and Fortran programming
languages, and to some extent Matlab, a popular (commercial)
high level matrix language.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>I hope you find it useful ...
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Background</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>I started working with high level languages when I realized I was
spending far too much time writing Fortran and C language programs
as a part of engineering analyses, test data reduction, and
continuing education. I searched for a better engineering
programming tool; except for Matlab, and some Matlab-like programs
(all commercial), I came up empty-handed (this was in 1989).  I did
not feel Matlab's language design was powerful enough, but I would
have used it had it been lower in cost and available on more
platforms. I diverted my ``off-hour'' studies to interpreter
construction, and started prototyping Rlab.  Within a year, I
released version 0.10 to the Internet for comment. Now, almost five
years later, Rlab has undergone significant changes and improvements
primarily due to excellent assistance from users around the world.
<P>Rlab does not try to be a Matlab clone. Instead, it borrows what I
believe are the best features of the Matlab language and provides
improved language syntax and semantics. The syntax has been improved
to allow users more expression and reduce ambiguities. The variable
scoping rules have been improved to facilitate creation of larger
programs and program libraries. A heterogeneous associative array
has been added to allow users to create and operate on arbitrary
data structures.
<P>This manual is intended to provide everything someone would need to
know to use Rlab. Sometimes this document may be terse, and
sometimes verbose. Instead of providing formal definitions of the
syntax and semantics of the language the program will be described
via discussion and examples. While this is likely to take more space
than a precise description of the language, it will be more useful
to most users. With that in mind, some might ask ``why not call it
the Rlab User's Manual''? Well, there probably should be two
manuals, but I am only one person and do not have the time or the
patience for both.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>
<P>Rlab has been ported to <EM>many</EM> platforms, so it should not be
too difficult to get it to compile on your particular computer.  At
one time or another Rlab has been ported to the following platforms:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> SCO Unix</LI>
<LI> UnixWare</LI>
<LI> Linux, both a.out and ELF</LI>
<LI> SunOS-4.1.x</LI>
<LI> Solaris 2.x</LI>
<LI> SGI Irix</LI>
<LI> HP-UX 9.0x</LI>
<LI> AIX 3.2.x</LI>
<LI> DEC Ultrix 4.x</LI>
<LI> Digital Unix (OSF v2.x on an Alpha)</LI>
<LI> Acorn RISC-OS</LI>
<LI> DOS (DJGPP)</LI>
<LI> OS/2 </LI>
<LI> Mac-OS</LI>
</OL>
<P>Although Rlab(2) is not currently ported to all the mentioned
platforms, the code is still fairly portable. The basic code is
ANSI-C, so any platform with an ANSI-C compiler and library should
be able to run the most basic part of Rlab: the interpreter, and
numerical functions. The biggest portability problems arise when
trying to get the data-visualization (graphics) working. Gnuplot is
probably the most portable. Additionally, there are PlotMTV, Plplot,
and PGraf graphics capabilities.
<P>
<H3>Quick Install</H3>

<P>
<P>This section will present the most basic of Rlab installations, as
briefly as possible. The assumptions are that everything will be
installed in <CODE>/usr/local</CODE>, you have an ANSI-C compiler, a
Fortran-77 compiler, and are not interested in graphics (yet).
<P><EM> Don't let the requirement for a Fortran-77 compiler bother
you.  A decent Fortran-77 (f77) compiler can be easily acquired as
part of the EGCS compiler suite.
See

</OL>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>At this point you should have Rlab installed and ready to run. Of
course there are many opportunities for trouble. If you do run into
trouble you should try reading the Detailed Installation section, or
check the <CODE>PROBLEMS</CODE> file contained in the Rlab source
distribution. 
<P>
<P>
<H3>Detailed Installation</H3>

<P>
<P>This section provides significantly more detail and discussion than
the Quick Installation Section. First a note about installation and
packaging philosophy. Rlab is now bundled together with the sources
for every required package that it uses.  Package size is not the
problem it was when I first started distributing Rlab (1989).
Moreover, some of the required packages (like FFTPACK) are special
double precision versions that many people have trouble finding.
The last obstacle to bundling the required packages was the poor
availability of Fortran-77 compilers; with the advent of the EGCS
compiler suites (including g77), this is no longer a problem.  So,
from version 2.1.00 on Rlab comes with the required Fortran
libraries, and the configure and Makefile support to build them
automatically.
<P>With an ANSI-C and Fortran-77 compilers available, the
configuration, build, and installation of Rlab is almost completely
automatic.  The one area that cannot be automated (if you know
otherwise please contact me: <CODE>searleir@yahoo.com</CODE>) is
determination of the C-language to Fortran-77 type mapping. Type
sizes in C can (and are) determined automatically but, there is no
equivalent to the C-language <CODE>sizeof()</CODE> in Fortran-77.  Thus,
the one place a user might have to intervene is to edit the
<CODE>typedef</CODE> statements at the bottom of <CODE>fi.h</CODE>.  To
successfully edit this file you need to know the byte sizes of
Fortran's <CODE>INTEGER</CODE>, <CODE>REAL</CODE>, and <CODE>DOUBLE</CODE>
types. Building Rlab on most modern (i.e. 32 bit flat memory)
systems will not require editing <CODE>fi.h</CODE>.
<P>Rlab consists of a core set of source code, certain required Fortran
libraries, and a set of optional libraries and programs:
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>core sources</B><DD><P>RLaB scanner, parser, compiler, virtual
machine, and object interfaces.
<P>
<DT><B>required Fortran libraries</B><DD><P>
<DL>
<DT><B>BLAS:</B><DD><P>basic linear algebra subroutines.
<DT><B>LAPACK</B><DD><P>linear algebra package
<DT><B>FFTPACK</B><DD><P>Fast Fourier Transform package.
<DT><B>RANLIB</B><DD><P>Random number and distribution library.
<DT><B>MINPACK</B><DD><P>Package for solving nonlinear equations and
nonlinear least squares problems.
</DL>
<P>
</DL>
<P>A fully functional Rlab installation can consist of many parts. So,
we will descri
it is good to be patient, and take the build one step at a time.
Rlab is developed on a Unix platform (Linux), and these installation
steps are geared towards building it on Unix-like systems.  The
first step to building RLab is to decide what configuration you
would like to build. Most of the options are:
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>Graphics</B><DD><P>Rlab can use Plplot or Gnuplot to handle the
data visualization chores. Plplot is a library that Rlab can
link to. Gnuplot is a stand-alone program that Rlab can use via
its I/O capabilities to interactively plot/visualize data.
<P>
<DT><B>Dynamic-Linking</B><DD><P>If your computer's operating system
supports dynamic linking (shared objects) well, then you can
use this feature within Rlab to load functions at runtime.
<P>
<DT><B>SuperLU</B><DD><P>The SuperLU package is a library for direct
factorization of large sparse matrices using a supernodal
technique. <EM>not implemented yet</EM>
<P>
<DT><B>UMFPACK</B><DD><P>The UMFPACK library contains routines for
performing direct factorization of large sparse matrices. The
license on this package is pretty restrictive (research and
educational only).
<P>
<DT><B>Metis</B><DD><P>Metis is a package for partitioning and ordering
graphs. This library can be used by Rlab to compute fill
reducing permutation vectors for sparse matrices.
<P>
<DT><B>Garbage-Collection (GC)</B><DD><P>Rlab-2 is designed to use Boehm's
generational garbage collector. The code for the collector
comes with Rlab, The configure/build process will try to use GC
by default. If you absolutely can't get GC to build, then you
can disable it.
<P>
<DT><B>Using a Fortran Compiler</B><DD><P>A Fortran-77 compiler can be
used for most of the supporting numerical analyses libraries
(BLAS, LAPACK, FFTPACK, and RANLIB). Sometime using a Fortran
compiler will produce libraries with better performance
(speed). Sometimes the difference is large, and sometimes
not. It really depends upon the computer architecture and the
compilers. 
<P>One of the drawbacks to using a Fortran compiler is the almost
total lack of standardization of consistent conventions from
vendor to vendor. This makes the task of auto-configuring for
Fortran compilation too difficult. If you want to compile the
libraries with a Fortran compiler there are examples and
guidelines for some of the more popular platforms. If you have
never attempted this before, you should consider building Rlab
entirely with a C-compiler first, so that you have a working
version while you get the Fortran libraries built.
<P>
</DL>
<P>Enabling any of the above options requires that you have built and
installed some sort of program or library on your system. 
<P>Rlab uses GNU autoconfigure to automatically detect operating system
features and installed programs. Under the luckiest of circumstances
you can configure Rlab by simply typing <CODE>./configure</CODE>. Under
more normal circumstances you may need to give configure some help
finding libraries, etc. Some of the most commonly used configure
options are:
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>--prefix=dir</B><DD><P><CODE>dir</CODE> is the root directory where Rlab,
and its support files will be installed. Without user
intervention <CODE>dir</CODE> defaults to <CODE>/usr/local/lib</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><B>--with-LIBS=dir</B><DD><P><CODE>dir</CODE> is a directory where configure
should look for libraries. This could be <CODE>/usr/local/lib</CODE>
on many systems.
<P>
<DT><B>--with-NALIBS=dir</B><DD><P><CODE>dir</CODE> is a directory where
configure should look for numerical analysis
libraries. Specifically, configure looks for <CODE>libClapack</CODE>,
<CODE>libCblas</CODE>, <CODE>libCfftpack</CODE>, and
<CODE>libCfftpack</CODE>. These libraries can be static, or shared
libraries. Configure tries to compile, and link a simple
program with each library. If configure can do this
successfully, then it adds the library name to the list of
"found" libraries.
<P>
<DT><B>--with-FLIBS=dir</B><DD><P><CODE>dir</CODE> is the directory where the
f2c libraries can be found. The f2c libraries are necessary to
resolve undefined externals in the translated Fortran sources
for the libraries.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Getting Started</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>This section provides a quick-start so the reader can run rlab
and try the examples, and ideas presented herein. It is assumed that
the user will run rlab from the command-line on some sort of
Unix-like system. Although Rlab runs on DOS, OS/2, Apple, and other
operating systems, only Unix systems will be covered in this
manual. 
<P>To run rlab type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <CODE>></CODE> displayed after the startup message is the rlab
prompt. At this point rlab is waiting for input. The expected input
is a program. The simplest and most often used introductory program
is:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>

Hello World
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Rlab echoes its input, unless it is directed not to. To silence Rlab
end each statement with a <CODE>;</CODE>
<P>Rlab provides an <EM>environment</EM>. The environment consists of a
<EM>global workspace</EM> occupied by variables. <EM>Local workspaces</EM>
are created on demand by functions. When executing commands/programs
interactively from the command line the programs execute within the
global workspace. Those familiar with Fortran or the C-language can
think of the global workspace as the main program.
<P>Any program that can be executed interactively, can also be executed
in <EM>batch mode</EM> by typing the program in a file, and executing
Rlab with the filename as an argument.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% cat > file.r

</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To exit Rlab type: <CODE>quit</CODE> or <CODE>Ctrl-d</CODE> at the prompt.
<P>
<P>
<H3>On-Line Help</H3>

<P>
<P>On-line help offers condensed versions of the reference pages for
each function, and brief discussion of the major concepts needed to
run rlab. A listing of the available help topics is obtained by
typing: <CODE>help</CODE> at the prompt. If, for example, you want help
with the <CODE>eig</CODE> function, you would type: <CODE>help eig</CODE>.
<P>The help system is simple by design. Each help topic or subject is
merely a text file, which is displayed to the terminal when
requested. This simplicity makes it correspondingly easy for users
to add to or modify the help system. If you find something in
particular that is missing, or is peculiar to your installation of
rlab, you can easily add to the help by creating a file, and placing
it in the rlab help directory.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Error Messages</H3>

<P>
<P>Two types of error messages occur when executing rlab programs: <EM>syntax</EM> errors, and <EM>run-time</EM> errors. Syntax errors are a
result of the parser's inability to make sense out of the
input. When a syntax error occurs, rlab will issue an error message,
and identify the syntax error.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> (1 + 2))
syntax error
(1 + 2))
      ^
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In the previous example, the error message identifies the extra
right parentheses as the offending character. Sometimes that syntax
error does not appear to make sense, for example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> ((1 + 2)
syntax error
((1 + 2)
       ^
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The error message identifies the right parentheses as the
error. But, most of us would think one of the left-parentheses is
the error. Actually, it is the lack of a second right-parentheses
that is the error. Rlab has a very precise definition of the
language syntax and semantics that do not always make sense to the
user.
<P>Run-time errors occur when a program, with legal syntax, tries to
perform an illegal operation. For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> a + 2
Entity types: Undefined and Matrix_Dense_Real
ERROR: rlab2: addition operation not supported
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This expression is valid, except in this context <CODE>a</CODE> is
undefined. The error message tries to tell us this by saying that
the addition cannot operate on <CODE>Undefined</CODE> and
<CODE>Matrix_Dense_Real</CODE> types.
<P>With either type of error execution will halt. If you are running
Rlab interactively, execution will return to the prompt. If Rlab is
running batch, then the process will terminate.

<P>
<H3>Rlab Environment</H3>

<P>
<P>Typically, when Rlab is built (compiled) knowledge of the
installation directory paths is built-in to the
executable. However, these default settings can be supplanted with
alternate definitions via the following environment variables.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>RLAB2_RC0</B><DD><P>The startup file.
<DT><B>RLAB2_HELP_DIR</B><DD><P>The principle directory of help files. 
<DT><B>RLAB2_LIB_DIR</B><DD><P>The directory of rfiles to load on
startup. 
<DT><B>RLAB2_PAGER</B><DD><P>The screen/terminal pager to use.
<DT><B>RLAB2_PATH</B><DD><P>A colon separated list of directories to
search when attempting to load rfiles. This directory
list should contain the <CODE>RLAB2_LIB_DIR</CODE> and the
Rlab toolbox directory.
<DT><B>RLAB_HISTFILE</B><DD><P>The name of the file to store the command
history in. The default is <CODE>.rlab_history</CODE>.
<DT><B>RLAB_HISTSIZE</B><DD><P>The length of the command history. The
default is 128.
</DL>
<P>Overriding the compiled-in definitions can happen at the system
level (for all users), or on a user-by-user basis, to accomodate
individual customizations. A good example is the Bourne-shell
script (normally contained in ./misc/rlab) that sets each
environment variable so that a pre-compiled binary can be used on a
system with a different installation directory.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Migrating From Rlab1 to Rlab2</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Moving from Rlab1 to Rlab2 is not very difficult. Most of the
changes between the two versions are internal to facilitate
simpler addition of new data-objects, and better memory
management. However, there are a few noteworthy changes made. These
changes make programming safer for all levels of users, and are a
result of extensive user feedback.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> So that users may keep Rlab1 installed on their computer,
Rlab2 is called <CODE>rlab2</CODE>, and the rfiles, help-files, etc are
kept in a separate directory hierarchy. A separate path environment
variable is required to make this work. <CODE>RLAB2_PATH</CODE> replaces
<CODE>RLAB_SEARCH_PATH</CODE>. You should keep both variables in your
environment if you have both Rlab1 and Rlab2 installed.
</LI>
<LI> The most significant change is with the way function
arguments are handled by the interpreter. In Rlab-1 function
arguments were passed by reference. In Rlab-2 function arguments
are passed by value. 

One of the reasons I used pass by reference in Rlab-1 was
efficiency. Many pass by value schemes copy a function's arguments
prior to passing execution to the function body. If the function
does not modify the arguments, then the copy was un-necessary. The
internal design of Rlab-2 allows function arguments to be passed by
value without un-necessary copies. If the function does not modify
an argument, then the argument is <EM>not</EM> copied. Only arguments
that are modified are copied.

My experience with many users is that very few actually take
advantage of pass by reference, and a great many are ``safer'' if
pass by value is the default.  Rlab-1 programs that don't take
special advantage of pass by reference (the great majority) will
work fine with Rlab-2.

<LI> Rlab2 uses a garbage collector for memory management. This
means you can forget about memory-leaks! It also means performance
is better.
</LI>
<LI> Most all of the rfiles have been re-vamped. Not because they
needed it. Most (99%) of Rlab1 rfiles will run without modification
in Rlab2. The only Rlab1 files that won't work correctly are the
ones that rely upon function argument pass-by-reference. My
experience tells me that this is very, very few rfiles.

An example of modified rfiles are show(), and who() that take
advantage of subtle, but new features in Rlab2.
</LI>
<LI> read() and write() only work in binary now. They still
offer a good degree of Matlab compatibility. readb(), and
writeb() are still there, but function the same as read() and
write(). ASCII read and writes can still be done with readm(),
and writem(). If there is a demand for the old ASCII read()/write(),
I will restore them. 
</LI>
<LI> Sparse real and complex matrices. These are brand new. The
implementation is still not complete. The matrix assignment,
partitioning, <CODE> +, -, *</CODE> operations are functional. But, there
is still lots to do here before they are "seamlessly" integrated
with the rest of the classes.
</LI>
<LI>  The help directory/files have been modified. This manual,
and the online help files originate from the same SGML
sources. There is also an HTML version of this manual for those who
want to get at online help that way.

<P>
<P>The availability of ``free'' software, such as GNU Emacs, GNU gcc,
gdb, gnuplot, Plplot, and last, but certainly not least, the Netlib
archives has made this project possible.  The Rlab author thanks
both the authors and sponsors of the GNU, LAPACK, RANLIB, FFTPACK,
and Plplot projects.
<P>Many individuals have contributed to Rlab in various ways. A list of
contributors can be found in the source distribution file
<CODE>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</CODE>. A special thanks to Phillip Musumeci who has
tirelessly provided a ftp-site for many years, and co-authored the
original RLaB Primer. Matthew Wette who has also provided ftp-sites
so that Rlab is available in the U.S.A. Special thanks are also due
to Tzong-Shuoh Yang who did the original Macintosh port, and has
provided many rfiles, and to Maurizio Ferrari who has ported Rlab to
the RISC-OS (Acorn) platform, and to Karl Storck for improving and
maintaining the Gnuplot interface.
