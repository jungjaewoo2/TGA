plln3:

Synopsis: Plot line segments in 3D space.

Syntax: plln3 ( PNTS )
        plln3 ( PNTS , THETA , PHI )
        plln3 ( PNTS , THETA , PHI , AXIS )
	plln3 ( PNTS , THETA , PHI , AXIS , NEW )

Description:

	Plln3 draws 3D line segments projected onto the current plot window.
	The required input is PNTS, a matrix of coordinate triplets: [X, Y, Z]

 	PNTS:  Matrix of [X,Y,Z] triplets.

	THETA: Defaults to 60 degrees. The angle (in degrees) of rotation 
               about the Z-axis.
	       
	PHI:   Defaults to 35 degrees. The angle (in degrees) of rotation 
               about the X-axis.
	       
	AXIS:  If AXIS is TRUE (1), then the 3 orthogonal axes will
               be drawn. Axis-1: [1, 0, 0], Axis-2: [0, 1, 0],
               Axis-3: [0, 0, 1].  The axes are scaled to the plot window. 
	       
	NEW:   If NEW is TRUE (1), then the current plot window is cleared prior
	       to drawing the line segment(s).  If NEW if FALSE (0),
	       the plot window will not be cleared.  When NEW is
	       FALSE, plimits should be used to ensure the plot window
	       does not change.
