plbar:

Synopsis: Plot Binned Data (Bar Chart)

Syntax: plbar ( DATA )

Description:

        plbar takes a single argument, DATA, and plots a a bar-chart
        of the 2:DATA.nr columns of DATA versus the first column (or
        the row numbers if DATA has a single column).

        plbar does _not_ compute, or plot, a histogram. If your data
        is already "binned" properly, then plbar will plot a
        histogram. But, If you want to plot a histogram from un-binned
        data-sets, you will have to use plhist().
