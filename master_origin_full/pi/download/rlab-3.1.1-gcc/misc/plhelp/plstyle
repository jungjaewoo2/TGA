plstyle:

Synopsis: Control the line style for 2-dimensinal plots.

Syntax: plstyle ( STYLE )

Description:

	Plstyle controls the line-style for 2-dimensional graphs.
	STYLE can be: "line", "point", and "line-point". The argument
	STYLE can be a vector of strings - in this case, the first
	line uses the first line-style, the 2nd line uses the 2nd
	line-style, and so-on. When all the line-styles have been
	used, the next line uses the 1st line-style, and the process
	starts all over again.
