<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Input and Output</A></H2>

<P>
<P>There are many ways to get data and programs in and out of
Rlab. First we will discuss how <EM>file-handles</EM> are specified,
and how they operate. Then we will cover program input, and quickly
move on to data input and output.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 File-Handles</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>File-handles are the mechanism through which the source of the
input, or the destination of the output is specified. File-handles
are deliberately simple; they are nothing more than strings. There
are three pre-defined file-handles: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE>"stdin"</CODE> allows input from the standard input
device. Typically, the keyboard.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>"stdout"</CODE> allows output to the standard output
device. Usually the terminal screen.</LI>
<LI> <CODE>"stderr"</CODE> allows output to the standard error device,
usually the same as the standard output, the terminal
screen. </LI>
</UL>
<P>Data can be read from or output to other devices or files by simply
specifying an alternate file-handle. Files are the simplest, the
file name is simply enclosed within double-quotes to make it a
string. Any string will work: a string constant, a string variable,
or and element of a string matrix. For example:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
line = getline("file.input");
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Will read a line of the file <CODE>file.input</CODE>.
<P>Functions that read or write data will automatically open files, so
an explicit open function is not usually necessary, although one
exists for special circumstances. Some functions will automatically
close files when the function has finished its task, others
won't. For example the function <CODE>readm</CODE> will read a single
matrix from a file. When <CODE>readm</CODE> is finished, it will close the
specified file. On the other hand, when <CODE>writem</CODE> is used it
will not close the file in case the user want to keep writing data. 
<P>Input and output can be performed from processes as well as
files. In order to read or write from a process build a string that
contains the process command. Make the first character of the
command string a <CODE>|</CODE>. Rlab will run the command following the
<CODE>|</CODE> reading the command's standard output, or writing to the
command's standard input. The pipe to/from the process input/output
will remain open until it is explicitly closed via the <CODE>close</CODE>
function.
<P>This is a very handy capability for communicating with other
programs. For example the an interface to the X-Geomview program can
be written entirely in an rfile using process I/O. The file handle
can be defined as:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
GEOM = "|/usr/local/bin/geomview -c -";
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The file handle is stored in a variable so it can easily be used
more than once. Commands, and data can then be sent to X-Geomview
with a statements like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
fprintf (GEOM, "%i  %i\n", ML.x.n, ML.y.n);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The X-Geomview process can be closed by:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
close(GEOM);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Programs</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Since Rlab offers an interactive mode of operation, programs can be
entered from the command line. Programs can be stored in files, and
loaded with either the <CODE>load</CODE> function, or the <CODE>rfile</CODE>
command. Additionally, programs can be read from the standard input,
or file names can be specified on the command line.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="reading-data"></A> <A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Data </A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>There are several methods available for reading and writing
data. Detailed information is available for each function in the
Builtin Function section of this manual, and in the online help. To
summarize:
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>write</CODE></B><DD><P>Write Rlab binary data files. <CODE>write</CODE>
can write numeric and string matrices, and lists in compact
binary form to a file. Since the byte-ordering is recorded,
the file can be read on many other computers (IEEE-754
compliant) .
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>read</CODE></B><DD><P>Read Rlab binary data files. Rlab keeps track
of byte-ordering on IEEE-754 compliant computers, so these
binaries can be written, and subsequently read on different
machines. The double-precision matrix structure is the same
as Matlab's, so Rlab can read and write Matlab files
containing matrices.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>writem</CODE></B><DD><P>Write a real-numeric matrix to a file in
ASCII format (human-readable). The matrix is output row at
a time, so that there are as many rows and column in the
output file as there are in the matrix. Only real matrices
are supported. To write a complex matrix the user must
first write the real, and then the imaginary parts:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> writem("file.output", real(z));
> writem("file.output", imag(z));
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>readm</CODE></B><DD><P>Read the an ASCII matrix from a
file. Normally reads the output from <CODE>writem</CODE>, but can
also read any text file that consists of white-space
separated columns of numbers. Each row must contain the
same number of columns. <CODE>readm</CODE> will take some
optional arguments that give it some knowledge of the input
file structure, and help it do a more efficient job.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>getline</CODE></B><DD><P>Reads a line of input. Default behavior is
to read a line of input, then break the input into fields
containing either numbers or strings, and return the
fields, in a list, to the caller. <CODE>getline</CODE> behavior
was patterned after AWK's own getline
function. <CODE>getline</CODE> can also read entire lines as a
string, which can then be split with the <CODE>strsplt</CODE>
function. Often, the <CODE>getline</CODE> - <CODE>strsplt</CODE>
combination is more efficient than <CODE>getline</CODE> itself.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>fread</CODE></B><DD><P>Read arbitrarily structured binary
files. This function is patterned after the C-language
fread. Of note is the argument that specifies the
byte-ordering of the input file. This argument allows users
to read files generated on different platforms.
<P>
<DT><B><CODE>fprintf</CODE></B><DD><P>Formatted ASCII output. This function is
patterned after the C-language fprintf.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
<H3>Examples</H3>

<P>
<P>At this point some examples are probably most useful. We will focus
on getting data into Rlab, since that is often the most
troublesome.
<P>
<H3>Readm Example</H3>

<P>
<P><CODE>readm</CODE> reads blocks of white-space separated numbers in a
file, and is useful for reading data from outside sources. Other
programs may not generate data quite the way you (or <CODE>readm</CODE>)
would like it, fortunately there are text-processing and formatting
tools like AWK which are well suited to the purpose of re-arranging
your data. In this example we will read differently formatted ASCII
files. The simplest is a file formatted with the same number of
columns per row, like so:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9  10  11  12
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>This file can be read, row-wise, with the statement:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> x = readm("file1.in")
        1          2          3          4  
        5          6          7          8  
        9         10         11         12  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>That is, each row of the input file is read, and becomes a row of
the resulting matrix.  The same file can also be read column-wise by
specifying the number of rows and columns to be read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> x = readm("file1.in", [3, 4])
        1          4          7         10  
        2          5          8         11  
        3          6          9         12  
> x = readm("file1.in", [4, 3])
        1          5          9  
        2          6         10  
        3          7         11  
        4          8         12  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Actually, the file is still read row-wise, but the matrix is filled
column by column according to the row and column specification in
the second argument.
<P>Now for something a little trickier. Suppose you have the following
file:
<HR>
<PRE>
1   2   3   4
5   6   7   8
9  10  11 

12  13  14  15
16  17  18  19
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>If you use <CODE>readm</CODE> without giving it some help, it will not
read all of that data.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> x = readm("file2.in")
        1          2          3          4  
        5          6          7          8  
        9         10         11         12  
       13         14         15         16  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CODE>readm</CODE> misses some of the data because it assumes each row of
the input file has the same number of columns. If you give it a
little help by telling it how many elements to read it will get them
all. 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> x = readm("file2.in", [1, 19])
 matrix columns 1 thru 6
        1          2          3          4          5          6  

 matrix columns 7 thru 12
        7          8          9         10         11         12  

 matrix columns 13 thru 18
       13         14         15         16         17         18  

 matrix columns 19 thru 19
       19  
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H3>Getline Example</H3>

<P>
<P><CODE>getline</CODE> is a useful tool for dealing with many types of
inputs. It is not always the most efficient, its strength lies in
ease of use. A few common uses of <CODE>getline</CODE> will be
show. First, the simplest usage:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
> printf("Input something > "); ans = getline("stdin");
Input something > a number 12.73e2
> ans
   1            2            3            
> ans.[1]
a  
> ans.[2]
number  
> ans.[3]
 1.27e+03
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <CODE>printf</CODE> statement creates the prompt: <CODE>Input something
></CODE>, and the <CODE>getline</CODE> statement reads the entire line of
input, splitting the line into fields separated by whitespace. Each
field, either a number or a string is stored in the returned list,
<CODE>ans</CODE>. The rest of the example just exposes the contents of the
list. 
<P>The next simple example shows how to use <CODE>getline</CODE> to read from
a file until the end-of-file (EOF) is reached.  When <CODE>getline</CODE>
encounters the end-of-file it returns a list with zero length. Thus
the <CODE>while</CODE> loop will execute until end-of-file.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
while (length (ans = getline("file1.in"))) 
{
   // Do something with each line...
}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Since <CODE>getline</CODE> is operating within a loop, its return value,
<CODE>ans</CODE> is overwritten each time the loop is executed. If the
contents of the file are to be saved for later use this must be done
within the loop. The following example shows how this might be
done. Here <CODE>getline</CODE> is used with a second argument that
specifies that the entire line be returned as a string.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
svec = [];
while (class (line = getline (FN, 0)) == "string")
{
  svec = [svec; line];
}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
<H3>Getline / Strsplt Example</H3>

<P>
<P>Reading in one type of data is most efficient with
<CODE>getline(FN,LL)</CODE> usage. That is, you tell <CODE>getline</CODE> to
read in the entire line as a string. Then you can use <CODE>strsplt</CODE>
to divide up the line most efficiently. This method is often more
efficient, because the combination of <CODE>getline</CODE> and
<CODE>strsplt</CODE> do less work because you guide them through the
process. If you force getline to split each line, it must examine
every character on the line itself. For example, you might have a
data file that looks like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
123 456 12  14 15
1 15 15 16 22 99 22
22 22 33 44 55 66
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It would be best to read this data with a small program that looked
like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
while ( class (line = getline("data", -1)) )
{
  x = strtod (strsplt(line, " "));
  # Do something with the data here...
}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The key here is intelligent use of <CODE>strsplt</CODE> and
<CODE>strtod</CODE>. <CODE>strsplt</CODE> breaks the string into pieces using
field separators specified in the second argument. <CODE>strtod</CODE>
converts its string argument to a number.
