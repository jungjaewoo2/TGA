<tag> Description </tag>


	Writem is the counterpart to readm. Writem writes the matrix
	<em>A</> to the file denoted by the 1st argument in a generic format.
	
	The format used is:

        <tscreen><verb>
line 1:		value[1;1]    ... value[1;ncol] \n
line nrow:	value[nrow;1] ... value[nrow;ncol] \n
        </verb></tscreen>

	Writem will write real and complex numeric matrices, as well
	as string matrices even though readm can only read real numeric
	matrices. Complex matrices are written as a single 2*nrow by
	ncolumn real matrix. Sparse matrices are written as triplets
	(row column value) for each element of the matrix.

	Writem does not close the file after writing <em>A</>. The file is
	left open for further writes if necessary. Close can be called
	to explicitly close the file.
