	RLaB trigonometric functions are designed to take scalars, and
	matrices as arguments. The return value is the input argument
	with the trigonometric operation performed element by element.

	The trigonometric functions use the C language math library
	functions, so details about the ranges and error conditions
	can be found by examining the appropriate man pages on your
	system.
