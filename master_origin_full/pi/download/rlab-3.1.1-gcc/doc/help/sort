        If A is a vector (either row or column):


          Then sort returns a list, containing the sorted values
          and indices. List element names are `val' and `ind'.


     If A is a matrix (m > 2):


          Then sort returns a list, containing a matrix with the
          sorted columns of A, and a matrix containing the sorted
          indices of A.


     Numerical matrices are sorted in ascending numerical value.
     Complex matrices are sorted by absolute value.  String matrices are
     sorted alphabetically (using strcmp()).

     The sort function uses a simplistic version of qsort.
