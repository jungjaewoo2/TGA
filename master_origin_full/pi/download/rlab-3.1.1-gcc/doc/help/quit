      [1mDescription[0m
        The statement quit causes RLaB to stop execution immediately.
        Quit is an executable statement, that is, it is not built into
        the parser, it only takes effect when executed.  This allows
        users to embed a quit statement in a branch of a conditional
        statement.

        RLaB can also be stopped by a ctrl-d (hold down the control key
        while typing `d').
