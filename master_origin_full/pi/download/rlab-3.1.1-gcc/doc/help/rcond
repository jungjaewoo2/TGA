      [1mDescription[0m
        Rcond computes an estimate of the condition number of the input
        matrix, [4mA[24m. rcond() uses the LAPACK routines DGECON, or ZGECON.

        Probably the most published way to compute the condition of a
        matrix is:



          Kcond = ||A|| * ||inv(A)||





     Another method is to use the 1st and last singular values of A:



          Kcond = sigma(1)/sigma(n)





     rcond computes an ESTIMATE of the condition number without
     computing all of the columns of inv(A). For more information see
     the LAPACK User's Guide.
