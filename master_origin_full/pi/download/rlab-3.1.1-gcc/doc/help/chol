      [1mDescription[0m
        Chol computes the Cholesky factorization of the input matrix.
        The input matrix must be real symmetric positive definite, or
        complex Hermitian positive definite.  chol() produces an upper
        triangular matrix [4mU[24m, such that U'*U and [4mA[24m (the input) are equal.

        chol use the LAPACK subroutine DPOTRF and ZPOTRF.
