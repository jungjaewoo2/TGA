Introduction
---------------------------------------

The ANSI C Time-Frequency toolbox is a package aimed at computing
time-frequency representations. One the one hand, it is an extension
of the Time-Frequency toolbox for use with Matlab
      http://crttsn.univ-nantes.fr/~auger/tftb.html 

since it provides some accelarated functions, and new ones. On the
other hand, this package provides C language sources that can be
included in any program.

Most of the functions are similar to those programmed in the
Time-Frequency toolbox for use with Matlab, and can be used in a
similar way. As it is programmed in C language, its use with Matlab
requires a ANSI C language compiler, compatible with your version of
Matlab.
