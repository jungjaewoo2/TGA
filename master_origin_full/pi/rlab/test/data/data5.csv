# Psilocybe semilanceata is a fungus whose mushrooms, known as liberty caps,
# are also called magic mushrooms for their psychedelic properties.
# They are the most common of the psilocybin mushrooms, and among the most potent.
# They have a distinctive conical or bell-shaped cap, up to 2.5 cm (1.0 in) wide,
# with a small nipple-like protrusion on the top. Yellow to brown in color and fading
# to a lighter color as they mature, they feed off decaying grass roots in fields,
# grassy meadows, and similar habitats, particularly in wet fields that are
# well-fertilized by sheep and cattle manure. The mushroom is widely distributed in
# the cool temperate and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly
# in Europe, and has been reported occasionally in India, South America, and Australasia.

# The earliest reliable history of P. semilanceata intoxication dates back to 1799 in London.
# In the 1960s the mushroom was the first European species confirmed to contain psilocybin;
# it was later found to contain the psychoactive compounds phenylethylamine and baeocystin
# as well. The possession or sale of psilocybin mushrooms is illegal in many countries.
