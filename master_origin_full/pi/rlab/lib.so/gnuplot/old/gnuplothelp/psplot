psplot:

Synopsis: Generates a PostScript file.

Syntax: psplot ( "file_name", "mode", I )

Description:

	The psplot() function generates a PostScript file named
	"file_name" of the current I:th plot. "mode" is further
	PostScript definitions to GNUPLOT if needed, for example
	"color 'Times-Roman' 14" for making a plot in color with
	Times-Roman-font size 14.  The PostScript plot is saved in a
	file for printing, or whatever.  Immediately after calling
	psplot(), the GNUPLOT variables term, and output are reset to
	there former values.

	The default value for the mode argument is: "default enh"
	(stands for default-enhanced). Valid options are: 

		"landscape"
		"portrait"
		"eps"
		"default"

	Technically "color" is not a valid gnuplot mode. But, "color"
	can often be specified in the mode argument.

	psplot() will not work with multiplot().  If a PostScript
	hardcopy is wanted in multiplot-mode, change the terminal type
	before and after leaving these modes.
	
	If 'I' is not specified the default plot-window is used, see
	defplotwin().
