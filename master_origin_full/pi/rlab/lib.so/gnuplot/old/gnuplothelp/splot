splot:

Synopsis: Create a 3-dimensional surface plot.

Syntax: splot ( X, Y, Z, KeyTitles, I )

Description:

	For 3D-plotting splot() makes a 3D-surface plot.
	This is in GNUPLOT a 3D-plot with no 
	
	The splot() function splots numeric data via the GNUPLOT program. The
	argument Z is a matrix as functions of vectors X and Y.
	The KeyTitles is a string-vector containing the titles to be plotted as keys.
	They are chosen beginning at KeyTitles[1] and so on.

	splot ( X, Y, Z )		splots the contents of matrix Z
					versus X and Y
	splot ( Z )			splots the contents of matrix Z
					versus rows and columns
	splot ( X, Y, [Z1,Z2] )         splots Z1, and Z2 on the same graph

	If 'I' is not specified the default plot-window is used, see defplotwin().
