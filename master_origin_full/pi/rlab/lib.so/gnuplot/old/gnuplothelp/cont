cont:

Synopsis: Create a 2-dimensional contour plot.

Syntax: cont ( X, Y, Z, KeyTitles, I )

Description:

	cont() makes a 2D-contour plot. This is in GNUPLOT a 3D-plot with no 
	surface.
	The KeyTitles is a string-vector containing the titles to be plotted as keys.
	They are chosen beginning at KeyTitles[1] and so on.

	cont ( X, Y, Z )		splots the contents of matrix Z
					as a 2D-contour-plot
	cont ( Z )			splots the contents of matrix Z
					versus rows and columns
	cont ( X, Y, [Z1,Z2] )		splots Z1, and Z2 on the same graph
					as a 2D-contour-plot

	If 'I' is not specified the default plot-window is used, see defplotwin().
