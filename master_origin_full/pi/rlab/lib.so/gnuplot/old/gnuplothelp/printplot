printplot:

Synopsis: Print the the current plot-window.

Syntax: printplot ( "printer-name", I )

Description:

	Print the the I:th plot-window to "printer-name".
	printplot() generates a PostScript file and sends it to 
	the printer.

	printplot() will not work with multiplot() or plotyy().
	If a print is wanted in multiplot- or plotyy-mode, 
	change the terminaltype before and after leaving these modes,
	using setterm(), to generate a PostScript hardcopy.

	If 'I' is not specified the default plot-window is used, see defplotwin().
