# Recommended way to do user overrides of C-related variables, is given at

# See also, CMakeCInformation.cmake.  There are also C++, and Fortran-specific
# overrides that can be done.  However, I prefer putting overrides in just
# one file so I use the overall variable CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
# instead.

# Note, that if you are using a platform that does not supply our
# designated minimum version of CMake for that platform, then your
# best bet is to build a recent version of CMake for yourself or even
# download a binary version of it from Kitware that is suitable for
# your platform.

# MAINTENANCE 2017-04
# We prefer to support only recent CMake versions and latest CMake
# policies to keep our build system as simple and as bug free as
# possible.  However, as a special concession for our modern (not
# enterprise or LTS) Linux distro users we allow them to use the
# system version of CMake which at this time is typically 3.7.2 (on
# Debian testing = Stretch which should become the Debian stable version
# some time later this year) or later.  So normally we would adopt 3.7.2 for the minimum
# CMake version on Linux and also that version for CMake policies on
# all platforms for CMake policy uniformity.  However, for non-Linux platforms
# we adopt 3.6.2 for the minimum version at this time because that is
# the maximum CMake version supported by Cygwin.  So as a temporary
# measure we adopt 3.6.2 as the Linux minimum version as well, but
# as soon as Cygwin bumps their CMake version to 3.7.2 or higher
# we will bump our Linux minimum to 3.7.2, and our non-linux minimum
# to the minimum version supported by both Cygwin and MinGW-w64/MSYS2
# (which is currently 3.7.2 in the latter case, but CMake-3.8.0 has been
# released so that may change.)

# Adapted method suggested by Brad King for using
# potentially different minimum versions for different platforms.
