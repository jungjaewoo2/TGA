	The latexplot() function generates a LaTeX file named "file_name" 
	of the current I:th plot. "mode" is further LaTeX definitions to 
	GNUPLOT if needed.
	The LaTeX plot is saved in a file for printing, or whatever. 
	Immediately after calling latexplot(), the GNUPLOT variables
	term, and output are reset to there former values.
	
	latexplot() will not work with multiplot() or plotyy().
	If a LaTeX hardcopy is wanted in multiplot- or plotyy-mode,
