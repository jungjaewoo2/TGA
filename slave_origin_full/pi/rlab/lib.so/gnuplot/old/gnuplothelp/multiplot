multiplot:

Synopsis: Set the current I:th plot-window in multiplot-mode.

Syntax: multiplot ( rows, columns, I )

Description:

	multiplot() allows you to make multiple plots in the I:th window. 
	After giving the command you enter multiplot-mode.
	
	If only 'I' is specified, the I:th plotwindow is set into
	multiplot-mode. You then have to leave multiplot-mode manually
	with "nomultiplot(I)".

	If 'row' and 'col' are specified, you leave multiplot-mode automaticly
	after making rows*columns plot-commands.
	
	The first plot made will appear in north-west, the second in 
	north-east, and so on.
	
	If 'I' is not specified the default plot-window is used, see defplotwin().
