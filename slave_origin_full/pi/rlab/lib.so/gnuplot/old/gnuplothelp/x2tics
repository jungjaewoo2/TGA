x2tics:

Synopsis: Sets the major tics on the top x-axis.

Syntax: x2tics ( start, incr, end, I )
        x2tics ( vector, I )
        x2tics ( I )

Description:

	The x2tics() function sets the major tics on the top x-axis 
	in the I:th plot-window. 
	If it is used as x2tics(start,incr,end,I), the tics will be set 
	for plot-window I, starting from "start", ending at "end", 
	with an increment of "incr". 
	If, however, it is used as x2tics([a,b,c,d],I), the tics will 
	set at "a", "b", "c" and "d" in plot-window I. 
	The command x2tics(I) will reset the tics in plot-window I.
	
	If 'I' is not specified the default plot-window is used, see defplotwin().
