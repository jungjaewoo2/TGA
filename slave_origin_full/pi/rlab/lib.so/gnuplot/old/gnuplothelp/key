key:

Synopsis: Turn keys on.

Syntax: key ( x, y, z, I )

Description:

	Turns keys on in the I:th plot-window. The keys will be placed at 
	x, y and z. If x, y and z are left out, the keys will be placed at
	the default position, the upper right corner.

	x can also be `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, `outside` or
	`below`, which will place the keys at these positions.
	For example, key("bottom,2), will place the keys at the bottom
	of the plot in the 2nd plot window,

	If 'I' is not specified the default plot-window is used, see defplotwin().

	(*) Be alert how you send this command. You will get into trouble
	if you try to send "I" without fully specified coordinates.
	Do not leave out "z" for example.
