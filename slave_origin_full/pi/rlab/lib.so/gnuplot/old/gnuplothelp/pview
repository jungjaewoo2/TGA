pview:

Synopsis: Change the view of a 3D plot

Syntax: pview ( ROTX , ROTZ , SCALE , SCALEZ , N )

Description:

	pview() controls how the 3-d coordinates of the plot are
	mapped into the 2-d screen space.

	ROTX: controls the rotation angle (degrees) about an axis that
	is horizontal in the plane of the display.

	ROTZ: controls the rotation angle (degrees) about an axis that
	is perpendicular to the display.

	SCALE: controls the scaling of the entire splot.

	SCALEZ: controls the scaling of Z-axis.

	The default values are ROTX=60, ROTZ=30, SCALE=1, SCALEZ=1.
