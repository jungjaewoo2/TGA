plfill:

Synopsis: RLaB graphics interface

Syntax: plfill ( A )

Description:

	Plot polygon A with pattern filled in the current sub-plot in 
        the current plot-window.  A can be a matrix, in which case the 
        columns are plotted against the 1st column representing the 
        vertices of the polygon. 

	A can also be a list, in which case each matrix in the list is 
        plottedi.

Example:
        a = (-0.75*pi:0.75*pi:0.1)';
        x = cos(a);
        y = sin(a);
        b = (-pi:pi:0.1)';
        xb = cos(b)*0.3 - 1;
        yb = sin(b)*0.3;
        pltitle("Pacman");
        plfill(<<[0,0;[x,y]];[xb,yb]>>);
