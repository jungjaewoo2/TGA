plhold:

Synopsis: 2-Dimensional incremental plotting.

Syntax: plhold ( A )

Description:

	Plhold can be used to incrementally create a 2-dimensional
	plot. This can be useful to display data/results while an
	analysis is in progres for monitoring purposes. After the plot
	is finished plhold_off() must be used to reset the plot-object
	attributes, and advance the "page" for the next plot.

	Note that if the plot line-style is set to "point", then
	plhold can be given a single point to plot. If the plot
	line-style is set to "line", then plhold must be called with
	at least two points in order to draw something visible.
