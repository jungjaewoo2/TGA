<tag> Synopsis </tag> Remove row-wise double entries from a data matrix.
<tag> Syntax </tag> rmdbls ( <em>A</em>, /idx/, /sidx/, /widx/ ) 
<tag> Description </tag>
rmdbls removes multiple row-wise entries from a data matrix with respect to the
column index <em>idx</em>, if given, otherwise <tt>idx=1</tt> is
assumed. Arrays <em>sidx</em> and <em>widx</em>, if given, are each two-column
matrices of indices in the form <tt>sidx=[ix1,isx1;..]</tt> or
<tt>widx=[ix1,iwx1;..]</tt>, containing values and their respective standard
deviations or their weights. This allows removal of data points with same value
of <tt>A[;idx]</tt> and replacing it with the weighted average in column
<tt>ix1</tt> and with weighted standard deviation in column <tt>isx1</tt>, or
with weighted weight in column <tt>iwx1</tt>. If <tt>sidx</tt> and
<tt>widx</tt> are not given then all double entries are replaced by their
means.

<tag>Note:</tag>
rmdbls assumes that the data is sorted with respect to the column <tt>idx</tt>
with respect to which the removal of the doubles is going to be performed.
