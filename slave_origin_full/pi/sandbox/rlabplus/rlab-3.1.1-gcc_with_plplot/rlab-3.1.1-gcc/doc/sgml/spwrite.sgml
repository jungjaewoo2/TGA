<tag> Description </tag>
	
	The spwrite function takes at least two arguments. The 1st
	argument is the string that identifies the file to write to.
	The file is opened with write permission, destroying any
	pre-existing contents. The file closed after the matrix is
	written.

	The default format for the sparse matrix is the internal
	storage format: compressed row-wise storage. See the Rlab
	Reference Manual for more explanation of this storage format.

	A third, and optional argument, is a string specifying either
	the default, or an optional output format. The value of the
	string can be either <tt>"sparse"</> (default) or
	<tt>"graph"</>. The graph output is a file suitable for use
	with the Metis or Chaco graph partitioning/re-ordering
	software.
