.SH NAME
rlab2 \- matrix oriented, interactive programming environment

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rlab2
[\-BVdhlmnpqr] [\-e "cmd1;cdm2;..."]
[file(s)]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rlab2
is an interpreter for the RLaB Programming Language/Environment.
The RLaB language is useful for matrix or array oriented numerical
analyses. RLaB is especially useful for prototyping and experimenting
with algorithms.

.B rlab2
interfaces many numerical and system libraries in c-language and FORTRAN:
e.g., BLAS and LAPACK for general linear algebra, FFTPACK for fast fourier
transform.
It uses the GSL for different solvers ranging from ordinary differential equations
to minimization and numerical integration to random number generation,
and structures (e.g., histograms) and special functions (from Airy to Zeta).
.B rlab2
can export data for visualization and additional postprocessing to gnuplot, xmgrace and openoffice.
It can work with special file formats (e.g., HDF5 or SPICE-RAW) and communicate with the scientific
instruments through GPIB and serial port, and with the world through raw sockets and http/https/ftp protocols.

.B rlab2
can communicate with python 2.6+ interpreter and so have access to python libraries
if such are not internally available.


.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\-\fBV
Prints the version number to stderr and exits.
.TP
\-\fBd
causes a readable form of the internal stack machine's compiled program
to be output to stderr. This option should be used in conjunction with
`-qln' options. This option is not intended for general use.
.TP
\-\fBh
prints the usage message to the screen and exits.
.TP
\-\fBl
prevents loading of the rlab library of rfiles.
.TP
\-\fBm
prevents printing of the greeting message.
.TP
\-\fBn
prevents line number and file name information from being used in the
internal stack machine codes. This option should only be used with the
`-dlnq'. This option is not intended for general use.
.TP
\-\fBp
prevents rlab from using the specified pager for all output.
.TP
\-\fBq
prevents loading of the startup file
.TP
\-\fBr
prevents usage of the GNU readline library for
command line editing.
.TP
\-\fBe "cmd1;cmd2;..." (since 2.2.12.15)
executes commands provided in the string between the quotation
marks after all the libraries are loaded, but before the files
provided as the arguments are loaded and the
command line is reached.
.TP
\fBfile(s)
are loaded and executed by rlab after the `.rlab' file, and after the
library files.
.TP
\-\fB
forces rlab to go interactive after all the files on the command line
have been executed.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.B rlab2
checks the values of several environment variables upon
startup, and uses them to overide the compiled in defaults. If a
particular environment variable has not been set, the default value is
used.

.B RLAB2_RC0
Startup rfile.

.B RLAB2_HELP_DIR
The principle directory of help files.

.B RLAB2_LIB_DIR
The directory of rfiles to load on startup.

.B RLAB2_PAGER
The pager to use for paging help
files to the screen. If
.B RLAB2_PAGER
is not set, then the environment is checked for
.B PAGER .
If neither exists, then the pager specified at compile time
is used.

.B RLAB2_PATH
A colon separated list of directories to search when
attempting to load rfiles. This directory list should contain the
.B RLAB2_LIB_DIR
and the RLaB toolbox directory. If
.B RLAB2_LIB_DIR
is not in the
.B RLAB2_PATH
, then there may be unresolved function variables.

.B RLAB_HISTFILE
The name of the command history file. If this variable does not exist,
then the default is $HOME/.rlab_history

.B RLAB_HISTSIZE
The size (length) of the command history to retain.

.SH EXECUTION
.B rlab
is normally executed from a shell command line. Upon startup
.B rlab
.nf
.sp
Processes the command line options.

Executes the `.rlab' file.

Executes any `.r' files in the library directory.

Executes any files specified on the command line.

Goes into interactive mode if no files are specified on the
command line, or if the `-' option is used.
.sp
.fi
.B rlab
can also be invoked by using the `#!' convention employed by exec(2).
A
.B rlab
script that begins with a line of the form:
.nf
.sp
	#! pathname [arg]
.sp
.fi
where \fIpathname\fR is the full pathname to the
.B rlab
executable, and \fIarg\fR is optional argument(s). Note that if the
`-' option is not specified
.B rlab
will not go interactive after the script has been executed.

.SH DOCUMENTATION
.B rlab
has an on-line help system, which can be accessed by typing `help'. A
tutorial and a reference manual are currently being worked on.

This man-page was not intended to provide a description of
the language, or rlab's features. Please refer to the manuals, or the
on-line help.

.SH BUGS
Paged output gets hosed after an `out of memory' message.

.B rlab
implements fprintf(), printf() and sprintf() using the
C library functions, fprintf, printf and sprintf, so
.B rlab
inherits any bugs or limitations of the library functions.

Send bug reports to: mkostrun@gmail.com.

Bug reports should include the rlab version number, a short rfile that
exercises the bug, and a description of the host operating system and
hardware.
