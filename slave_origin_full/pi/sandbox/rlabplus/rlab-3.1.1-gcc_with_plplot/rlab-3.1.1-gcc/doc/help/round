      [1mDescription[0m
        Round returns the nearest integer value to its floating point
        argument [4mX[24m as a double-precision floating point number. The
        returned value is rounded according to the currently set machine
        rounding mode. If round-to-nearest (the default mode) is set and
        the difference between the function argument and the rounded
        result is exactly 0.5, then the result will be rounded to the
        nearest even integer.

        Round uses the libm.a function rint. If your machine does not
        have rint, then the supplied rint is used.
