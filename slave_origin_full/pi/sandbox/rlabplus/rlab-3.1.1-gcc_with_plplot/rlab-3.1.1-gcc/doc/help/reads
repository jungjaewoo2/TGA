      [1mDescription[0m
        reads( ) reads input from keyboard until `return' is pressed.
        reads( [4mfilename[24m ) reads the content of the file in a single
        column string vector. If the [4mfilename[24m  begins with `|' then the
        reading is performed from the pipe. The latter is the modus
        operandi of many functions in RLaB2 Rel. 2 that communicate with
        shell, e.g., see dir, ls, email, md5sum etc. For example,


          ys = reads  (`my_file_with_lots_of_data');
          y  = strtod (ys);




     Or, another example where a pipe to shell command is used,


          fns = reads  (`| ls -1A');
          for (fn in fns)
          {
            printf (`Found file: ');
            printf (`%s', fn);
          }
