        min ( [4mA[24m )

        min ( [4mA[24m, [4mB[24m )

      [1mDescription[0m
        Min returns the minimum value(s) contained in the matrix [4mA[24m. If
        the argument is a vector, then the smallest value is returned.
        If [4mA[24m is a MxN matrix, then a row-vector of N columns is returned
        containing the minimum value from each column of [4mA[24m.

        If min is used with two arguments, then min returns a matrix the
        same size as [4mA[24m and [4mB[24m filled with the smallest elements from [4mA[0m
        and [4mB[24m.

        When matrix elements are complex the absolute value is used for
        comparison purposes.
