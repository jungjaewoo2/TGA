        ifft ( [4mX[24m )

        ifft ( [4mX[24m, [4mN[24m )

      [1mDescription[0m
        Ifft utilizes the FFTPACK subroutine CFFTB to compute a discrete
        Fourier transform of the input. The output is scaled by 1/N, so
        that a call to fft() followed by a call to ifft() will reproduce
        the original input.

        If ifft is used with a second argument, [4mN[24m, then the matrix [4mX[24m is
        either padded with zeros, or truncated till it is of length [4mN[0m
        (if [4mX[24m is a vector), or has row dimension [4mN[24m (if it is a matrix).

        Subroutine CFFTB computes the backward complex discrete Fourier
        transform (the Fourier synthesis). equivalently, CFFTB computes
        a complex periodic sequence from its Fourier coefficients.



                  for j=1,...,n

                     c(j)=the sum from k=1,...,n of

                           c(k)*exp(i*(j-1)*(k-1)*2*pi/n)

                                   where i=sqrt(-1)





     The argument [4mX[24m must be a matrix. If [4mX[24m is a row, or column matrix
     then a vector ifft is performed. If [4mX[24m is a MxN matrix then the N
     columns of [4mX[24m are ifft'ed.
