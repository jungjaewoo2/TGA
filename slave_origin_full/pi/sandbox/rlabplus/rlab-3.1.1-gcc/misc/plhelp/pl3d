pl3d:

Synopsis: Draw 3-dimensional lines.

Syntax: pl3d ( X, Y, Z, BR )

Description:

	pl3d draws lines in a 3-dimensional plot. The arguments X, Y,
	and Z contain the coordinates of the endpoints of the line.

	Example:

		# Draw a single line in 3-D
		pl3d ([x1; x2], [y1; y2], [z1; z2])

	The X, Y, and Z arguments can contain more 2 elements, in
	which case N-1 (N is the dimension of X, Y, and Z) lines will
	be drawn.

        The last argument, BR (optional), specifies BReakpoints in the
	line. Without BR, the line conects all specified
	coordinates. When BR is specified, the line is broken every N
	points.
