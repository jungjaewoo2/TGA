<tag> Description </tag>

	The schur function returns a list containing elements <em>t</>
	and <em>z</>, such that:

	<quote>	
		<em>A = z * t * z'</>
	</quote>

	If <em>A</> is real, the <em>t</> is in "Real-Schur" form. The
	"Real-Schur" form is block upper-triangular with 1-by-1 and
	2-by-2 diagonal blocks; each 2-by-2 diagonal block has its
	diagonal elements equal and its off-diagonal elements of
	opposite sign. The eigenvalues of the 2-by-2 block: 
	<tt>[a, b; c, a]</> are: <tt>a +/- sqrt(b*c)</>

	schur uses the LAPACK subroutines DGEES, and ZGEES.
