<tag> Description </tag>

	Load opens the file named <em>filename</> and reads its
	contents as though a user were typing the contents at the
	command line. Thus a user can use load to enter data,
	user-functions, or execute repetitive commands saved in a
	file. there is no limit to the number of functions, or regular
	statements that can exist in a file called by load.

	Immediately after the the input is read, load closes the
	file, so that subsequent calls to load will re-open the
	file.

	Load requires that a complete file specification be provided.
	If the file is in the present working directory, then only the
	filename is necessary otherwise, a complete path is required.

	In most cases the rfile command is simpler to use.

	Example:
<tscreen><verb>
// load the roots() function into memory
> load( "roots.r" )
</verb></tscreen>
