<tag> Description </tag>

	close takes a string (<em>filename</>) as input, and attempts
	to close the output stream associated with
	<em>filename</>. close returns TRUE (1) if the output stream
	was successfully closed, FALSE (0) if the output stream could
	not be closed.

	If you want to read the contents of a file that you have
	created with the write function in the present session, then
	be sure to close the file before using the read function.

	Example:
	<tscreen><verb>
write( "eig_output", a , vec , val );
close( "eig_output" );
read( "eig_output" );
	</verb></tscreen>
