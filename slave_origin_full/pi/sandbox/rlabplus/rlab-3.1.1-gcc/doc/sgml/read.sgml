<tag> Description </tag>

	read reads the file identified by the <em>FILENAME</>. The
	file is opened with read access, and all of the contents are
	read.  The file identified by the 1st argument must contain
	data that is in RLaB binary format.  The entities in the file
	are installed in the global symbol table, overwriting any
	existing entities. Upon completion the file is closed.

	Example:

        <tscreen><verb>
read ("bunch_of_data_in_a_file");
        </verb></tscreen>

	The second form of the read function allows the data in the
	file to be read into list variable <em>LIST</>. The
	global-symbol-table is untouched (except for <em>LIST</>).

	Example:

        <tscreen><verb>
read ("bunch_of_data", X);
        </verb></tscreen>

	The contents of the file <tt>bunch_of_data</> are read and
	stored in the list variable <tt>X</>. Except for the
	creation/modification of the variable <tt>X</>, the
	global-symbol-table is unchanged.

	Read will read most numeric matrices written by MATLAB's save
	command. Read will not read MATLAB text matrices, or sparse
	matrices, or matrices written with reduced precision (integer
	format). Read will not read Cray, or VAX binaries. Read will
	read big and little endian binaries - this includes binaries
	written from PCs, DEC Risc, Macintosh, Sun, and Apollo.
