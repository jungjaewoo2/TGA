<tag> Description </tag>

	The statement <tt>quit</> causes RLaB to stop execution
	immediately. Quit is an executable statement, that is, it is
	not built into the parser, it only takes effect when executed.
	This allows users to embed a quit statement in a branch of a
	conditional statement.

	RLaB can also be stopped by a ctrl-d (hold down the control
	key while typing `d').
