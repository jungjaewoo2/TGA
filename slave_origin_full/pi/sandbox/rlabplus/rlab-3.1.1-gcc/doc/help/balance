      [1mDescription[0m
        Balance uses the LAPACK subroutines DGEBAL and ZGEBAL to balance
        the input matrix so that the row and column norms are
        approximately equal.

        balance returns a list with elements [4mt[24m and [4mab[24m.

        Example:


          > a
                  0          0          1          0
                  0          0          0          1

                 10         11          0          0
          > </ ab ; t /> = balance(a);
          > inv(t)*a*t - ab
