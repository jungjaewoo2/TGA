      [1mDescription[0m
        The write_ascii function takes at least two arguments. The 1st
        argument is the string that identifies the file to write to.
        The file is opened with write permission, destroying any pre-
        existing contents. The file is left open so that subsequent
        writes will append to the file, and not destroy the contents.

        The arguments after the file name are the objects that will be
        written. All objects are written in RLaB ASCII format.

        Example:



          write_ascii ( "filename", a , b , c );




     Will open the file named filename in write mode, and write the
     contents of the variables a, b, and c.
