      [1mDescription[0m
        Int returns its argument after it has been "cast" to an integer.
        If the argument is a MATRIX then the int operation is performed
        on an element-by-element basis.

        int has the effect of truncating the input, for example:


          >> int(1.1)
                     1
          >> x=int(1.9)
                     1
          >> type(x)
          real
          >> x.type
          int
