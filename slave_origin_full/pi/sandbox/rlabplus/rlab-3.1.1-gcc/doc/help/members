      [1mDescription[0m
        The members function takes a variable as an argument ([4mL[24m), and
        returns a string-vector containing the object's member names.

        For example: x = members ($$) will create a row-vector and
        assign it to [4mx[24m. The row-vector will contain the names of all the
        elements in the global-symbol-table.

        The members function is probably most useful when used in
        conjunction with for-loops. The result of members can be used as
        the loop index, allowing users to operate on the elements of an
        object. For example:



          ll = << a = rand(3,3); b = rand(3,3); c = rand(3,3) >>;
          for (i in members (ll)) { ll.[i] = diag(ll.[i]); }
