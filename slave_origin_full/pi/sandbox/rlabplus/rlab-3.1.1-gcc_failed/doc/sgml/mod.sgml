<tag> Description </tag>

	The mod routine returns the floating point remainder of the
	division of <em>A</> by <em>B</>: zero if <em>B</> is zero or
	if <em>A</>/<em>B</> would overflow; otherwise the number F
	with the same sign as <em>A</>, such that <em>A</> = i<em>B</>
	+ F for some integer i, and |f| &lt; |B|.

	When the arguments to mod are two matrices, then an element by
	element mod is performed. Mod works on complex number also.

	mod(x,y) is equivalent to: 
	<quote>
	n = int( x/y )
	</quote>

	<quote>
	mod(x,y) = x - y.*n
	</quote>

	mod is implemented via libm.a fmod function.
