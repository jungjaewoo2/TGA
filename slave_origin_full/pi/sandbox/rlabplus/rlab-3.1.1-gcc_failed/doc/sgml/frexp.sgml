<tag> Description </tag>
	
	Frexp returns a list with elements <em>f</> and <em>e</>
	Frexp splits <em>A</> into a normalized fraction in the interval:

	<tscreen><verb>
		0.5 <= abs(f) <= 1
	</verb></tscreen>

	which is returned in <em>f</>, and a power of 2, which is returned
	in <em>e</>. If <em>A</> is zero, then both <em>e</> and
	<em>f</> are zero.

	Frexp operates on REAL matrices of any dimension.
