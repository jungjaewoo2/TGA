        fwrite ( [4mFILENAME[24m, [4mTYPE[24m, [4mDATA[24m )

      [1mDescription[0m
        fwrite writes [4mDATA[24m to the file identified by [4mFILENAME[24m. [4mDATA[24m is
        cast, or converted to the data type identified in [4mTYPE[24m. fwrite
        roughly mimincs the C programming language's fwrite library
        function.

        [4mDATA[24m can either be a dense numeric matrix, or a string matrix.
        The size of the matrix does not need to be specified because the
        entire matrix is written.

        If [4mDATA[24m is a string matrix, then the first character of each
        element is written to [4mFILENAME[24m, after being coerced to type
        [4mTYPE[24m.

        Allowable arguments are:


        [4mTYPE[0m

             "unsigned char"
