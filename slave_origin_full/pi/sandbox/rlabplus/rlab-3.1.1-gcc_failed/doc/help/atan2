      [1mDescription[0m
        RLaB trigonometric functions are designed to take scalars, and
        matrices as arguments. The return value is the input argument
        with the trigonometric operation performed element by element.

        atan2 takes two arguments, which are the y, and x values used to
        form the tangent. All the trigonometric functions use the C
        language math library functions, so details about the ranges and
        error conditions can be found by examining the appropriate man
        pages on your system.

        Atan2 does not operate on complex arguments.
