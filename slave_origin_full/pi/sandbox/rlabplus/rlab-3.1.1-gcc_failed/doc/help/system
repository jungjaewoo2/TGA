      [1mDescription[0m
        The system function behaves like the the UNIX system call. The
        string argument to system, [4mCOMMAND[24m, is passed directly to the
        bourne-shell for execution. The program waits until the system
        call is finished.

        Example:


          > system( "vi test.r" )




     will allow the user to edit (create) the file test.r. When the vi
     process is finished the user will be back at the RLaB prompt.



          > rfile test




     will then load the result of the vi process.
