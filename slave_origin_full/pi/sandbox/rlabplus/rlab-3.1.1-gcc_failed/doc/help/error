      [1mDescription[0m
        The error function allows user-functions to jump back to the
        prompt when some sort of error has occurred. The nature of the
        error is up to the user. When an error is detected the user
        simply calls error(). If no argument is supplied, error() will
        print the default message. Otherwise, error prints the string
        supplied as an argument, and jumps back to the prompt.

        Jumping "back to the prompt" means execution of the current loop
        or function is terminated immediately and execution of any
        prompt-level statements is performed.
