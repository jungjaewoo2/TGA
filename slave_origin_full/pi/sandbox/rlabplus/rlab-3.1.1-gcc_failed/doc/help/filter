      [1mDescription[0m

           Filter is an implementation of the standard difference
           equation:


               y[n] = b(1)*x[n] + b(2)*x[n-1] + ... b(nb+1)*x[n-nb]
                    - a(2)*y[n-1] - ... a(na+1)*y[n-na]




        The filter is implemented using a method described as a "Direct
        Form II Transposed" filter. More for information see Chapter 6
        of "Discrete-Time Signal Processing" by Oppenheim and Schafer.


      [1mInputs[0m

        [4mB[24m  The numerator coefficients, or zeros of the system transfer
           function.  The coefficients are specified in a vector like:


             [ b(1) , b(2) , ... b(nb) ]




        [4mA[24m  The denominator coefficients, or the poles of the system
           transfer function. the coefficients are specified in a vector
           like:


              [ a(1) , a(2) , ... a(na) ]




        [4mX[24m  A vector of the filter inputs.

        [4mopt[0m
           A list which entries specify initial delays through entry [4mzi[24m,
           or initial values of filter output [4my0[24m, both given as an array
           of size max(dim(A),dim(B))-1.


      [1mOutput[0m
        List with entries


        [4my[24m  The filter output. [4my[24m is a vector of the same dimension as [4mX[24m.

        [4mzf[24m A vector of the final values of the filter delays.

        The A(1) coefficient must be non-zero, as the other coefficients
        are divided by A(1).
