        Read ASCII data from a file.

      [1mSyntax[0m
        read_ascii ( [4mFILENAME[24m )

        read_ascii ( [4mFILENAME[24m, [4mLIST[24m )

      [1mDescription[0m
        read_ascii reads the file identified by the [4mFILENAME[24m. The file
        is opened with read access, and all of the contents are read.
        The file identified by the 1st argument must contain data that
        is in RLaB ASCII format.  The entities in the file are installed
        in the global symbol table, overwriting any existing entities.
        Upon completion the file is closed.

        Example:



          read_ascii ("bunch_of_data_in_a_file");





     The second form of the read function allows the data in the file to
     be read into list variable [4mLIST[24m. The global-symbol-table is
     untouched (except for [4mLIST[24m).

     Example:



          read_ascii ("bunch_of_data", X);





     The contents of the file bunch_of_data are read and stored in the
     list variable X. Except for the creation/modification of the
     variable X, the global-symbol-table is unchanged.
