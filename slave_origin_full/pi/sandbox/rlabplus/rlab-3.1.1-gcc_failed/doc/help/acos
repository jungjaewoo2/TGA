        The trigonometric functions are scalars functions.  The return
        value is the result of the trigonometric operation performed on
        the input, element-by-element.

        All the trigonometric functions use the C language math library
        functions, so details about the ranges and error conditions can
        be found by examining the appropriate man pages on your system.
