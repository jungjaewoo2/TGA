      [1mDescription[0m
        Class returns a string which identifies the type of the object
        that [4mA[24m represents. Valid classes are:


     +o  num

     +o  string

     +o  list

     +o  function

        It is often useful to:



          if(class(m) == "num")
          {
            # Perform numerical computation on m
          }




     The class of a variable can also be determined by using the class
     member reference (except for LISTs), like:



          > zeros.class
          function
