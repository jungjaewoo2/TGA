Synopsis: Set the grid type for the current sub-plot.

Syntax: plgrid ( GRID_STY_X , GRID_STY_Y )

Description:

	Set the grid type for the current sub-plot in the curent
	plot-window. The grid type is specified by a string. The
	possible elements of the string are described below. The
	string can include any combination of the following letters
	(lower case) in any order. If plgrid is called without any
	arguments, the defaults are reset. 

	a	Draws axis, X-axis is horizontal line 
		(at y=0), and Y-axis is vertical line (at x=0).

	b	Draws bottom (X) or left (Y) edge of frame.
	c	Draws top (X) or right (Y) edge of frame.
	g	Draws a grid at the major tick interval.
	i	Inverts tick marks, so they are drawn
		outwards, rather than inwards.
	l	Scales axis logarithmithecally.
	m	Writes numeric labels at major tick intervals 
		in the unconventional location 
		(above box for X, right of box for Y).
	n	Writes numeric labels at major tick intervals 
		in the conventional location 
		(below box for X, left of box for Y).
	s	Enables subticks between major ticks, only
		valid if "t" is also specified.
	t	Draws major ticks.

	Example - Set X and Y logarithmic scales:

		plgrid ( "bcgnstl", "bcgnstlv")
