Description:

	Set the grid type for the current sub-plot in the curent
	plot-window. The grid type is specified by a string. The
	possible elements of the string are described below. The
	string can include any combination of the following letters
	(lower case) in any order. If plgrid3 is called without any
	arguments, the defaults are reset. 

	b	Draws axis at base, at height 
		(z=zmin). This character must be specified
		in order to use any of the other options.
	i	Inverts tick marks, so they are drawn
		downwards, rather than upwards.
	l	Scale axis logarithmically. 
	n	Writes numeric labels at major tick intervals.
	s	Enables subticks between major ticks, only 
		valid if "t" is also specified.
	t	Draws major ticks.
	u	If this is specified, the text label for the 
		axis is written under the axis.
